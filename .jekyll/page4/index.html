Phew!!! Finally I am happy with the redesign. Yes, aliirz.com has been going through a major redesign phase from the past few weeks and now finally its complete(I think so). So (clears throat) lets talk about what&#8217;s new.</p>
<p>The website now uses the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation Framework</a> which has become my most favourite prototyping <span class="caps">CSS</span> framework since Startup Weekend Lahore. The most used and favourite feature of mine is the grid(not the one from Tron) as it allows creating a flexible, fully customizable layout in seconds. So bascially you can prototype anything be it a website for the web or mobile devices, foundation has all you need to go in uber prototyping mode. Also foundation has built-in support for creating responsive designs(Something I still need to hook up here).</p>
<p>Some other things I have changed are a new header and footer section utilizing the power of Jekyll includes so I have more control over the <span class="caps">HTML</span>. You can see the main page has two columns now so that content is more properly arranged. I have a new <a href="/Folio">Folio</a> section which only lists a handful of my projects at the moment. The post headings have now got a CSS3 transition property to their background. The site background is now white to improve readability and now users can subscribe to <span class="caps">RSS</span> Feeds as well.</p>
<p>Do leave your comments and feedback on how things look and what can be improved. I am re-learning the web and I am loving it. Cheers :)</p>

				<a href="/.net/2012/02/24/MVC3-Html-Attributes/">HTML and CSS Attributes in MVC3</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<p>For those of you who use or are learning asp.Net MVC3 might know that it introduces some very useful <span class="caps">HTML</span> helpers with its razor view engine. Sometimes the need is to customize the rendered out <span class="caps">HTML</span> a little bit more with <span class="caps">CSS</span> or <span class="caps">HTML</span> attributes. So this small post shows how to do that. Imagine you are using a textbox <span class="caps">HTML</span> helper in your razor view to render a textbox but you want to use a custom <span class="caps">CSS</span> class as well as a placeholder to it so that it looks very very pretty. In order to do just that you need to declare your textbox <span class="caps">HTML</span> helper like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="csharp"><span class="n">@HTML</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Textbox</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Searchbox&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="k">null</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">@class</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;prettyTextbox&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">@placeholder</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;This is placeholder Text&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> 
</code></pre></div><p>Which will render out a textbox like:</p>
<input type="text" placeholder="This is placeholder Text"/>
<p>Similarly you can use other <span class="caps">HTML</span> attributes inside your helpers to render out the kind of <span class="caps">HTML</span> you want. You have full control over the rendered out <span class="caps">HTML</span>.</p>

I have never seen so many entrepreneurs under one roof ever in my life. I always wanted to to go to one of them techcrunch&#8217;s disrupts to meet with others like me and network. I never imagined I would get the chance to attend an even more awesome event in my own country.</p>
<p>It was a last minute decision to attend this amazing event in Lahore. What I hadthought to be a simple participation turned into an energy-filled, nerve wrenching hackathon 54-hours straight. I will be very honest I had never thought of writing so much code in a day and that too in a simple text editor.</p>
<p>Launching a startup was not the only reason we attended the event. The other reason was networking and getting the chance to meet big names from the Industry in Pakistan. All those seniors became mentors and helped each and every participant build the best project. I too became acquaninted to very inspirtation people like Afaque Ahmed from Breezecom, Raza Saeed from Confez Solutions and Saj Khan from Scrybe. Not only that but I found good friends as well like Junaid Atique, Kamil Waheed and Jaiser Abbas.</p>
<p>If there is a <a href="http://startupweekend.org/">startup weekend</a> coming up near where you live, I totally recommend checking it out. You will not be sorry!</p>
<p>It was a very energetic event and it opened a whole new world for me. I am so looking forward to take over the world piece-by-piece ;)</p>

				<a href="/git/2012/02/12/Push-Local-Git-Branch-to-Remote-Repo/">Push Local Git Branch To Remote Repo</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<p>This post is for those who are new to the Git System. I am going to show how to create a new branch of a git repo, push it to remote repo and finally check it out on another machine.</p>
<p>The first thing, create a new branch based on an existing branch with the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">git checkout - b <span class="s1">&#39;New-Branch&#39;</span> 
</code></pre></div><p>The above command creates and switches to the newly created branch.</p>
<p>Then this is how you push it to the remote repository:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">git push origin New-Branch 
</code></pre></div><p>All set, the newly created branch has been pushed to the remote repository. Now how will we access it on another System? Thats easy too, the first thing that needs to be done on the other system is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">git fetch origin 
</code></pre></div><p>This will update the repo with the changes from remote repo. But wait this will not add the newly created branch yet, note that it has been fetched but is not being tracked yet. To do that we use the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash">git checkout --track origin/New-Branch 
</code></pre></div><p>Yes, thats it. Hope this post will help someone. Cheers.</p>

				<p>I came across this beautiful timelapse video on vimeo. It has deeply inspired me. The way the original creator of the video has captured our universe is very unique. The way you can see the whole galaxy move is so soothing that its easy for the watcher to get deeply immersed in the experience. Boy, I am gonna buy a telescope for star gazing.</p>
<p>Here is the video:</p>

I came across <a href="http://www.timehop.com">Timehop</a> a week ago. The idea behind it was so simple and sounded way too fun that i signed up instantly, who would not want to be reminded of the past(except for the embarrasing moments)? Basically it sends you an email of all your social network(s) activity for the same date of the last year. So its like a time machine that reminds you what were you upto last year the very same day. It does not spam you(Thank God), one email a day is not overkill. As a matter of fact I find myself waiting for my morning&#8217;s dose of Time Travel back to my facebook and twitter feeds from an year ago.</p>
<p>Its a great idea and I would really like to see it grow into Mobile Apps and a manual timeline browser someday. Still reading? go Timehop a little, jog your memory.</p>
