			</h1>
			<p>
				<p>We installed <a href="http://www.yetanotherforum.net" target="_blank">yet another forum</a> on one of our private servers the past week. My job was to set it up the theme, smtp and access roles. So everything went well until I came to the most important requirement of them all:</p>
<p>The newly registered users were supposed to be in a very limited access role and once their identities were confirmed, the admin was to move them to full member access. This all was setup, but whenever I moved a user to full member access the account would still retain limited access of the first role assigned. This became annoying! So after a little googling I found out that there is cache inside YAF&#8217;s db; a table called ActiveAccess. When you clear the table manually it resets the cache. There is a Stored Procedure as well &#8220;yaf_activeaccess_reset&#8221; for easier operation.</p>
<p>So I created a small utility that clears the cache after every four hours. Code Available here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/aliirz/YAFCacheCleaner" target="_blank">https://github.com/aliirz/YAFCacheCleaner</a></p>
<p>Its easy shneezy! Please not that this issue of cache not being cleared up is fixed in <span class="caps">YAF</span> version 1.9.6 <span class="caps">BETA</span>. But if you are  using 1.9.5 Stable you will have to do it manually or show patience for it to clear automatically(trust me, takes a while). Otherwise you can also run the utility i mentioned above.</p>
<p>Hope its helpful :)</p>

			</h1>
			<p>
				<p>We learn so many things in life from the greatest of teachers, yet they seem to become inapplicable or simply don’t come in our shallow minds when needed. Be it a valuable lesson you learn from a fight you had, or something you learnt by simply watching a little insect trying to climb a wall desperately, or some valuable piece of words otherwise known as sentence shining like gold spoken by somebody’s mouth or read from a book. Our deep lost in logic minds cant think of the logic of these lessons whenever needed. so called think tanks we are… We become what we do all day. We do things sometimes so brutal so unexpected that our hearts fill with guilt and sorrow. sometimes its our past experience with people and in some cases its our deepest darkest secret we cant afford to recall at any cost. What we forget is that we already have the arsenal to overcome any grief, fear or simply a panic attack. in the form of valuable lessons. life has been and will always prepare us for the things to come…al we have to do is have faith, believe and keep our hearts and minds free..</p>
<p><em>Throw the guilt about the past and stop worrying about the future, live in the present, before it becomes the past. <strong>-Faez H. Seyal</strong></em></p>

				<p>Ali&#8217;s Blog</p>
<p>Stardate [-28]5546.73</p>
<p>After having a few adventures with <span class="caps">PHP</span> and Asp.net <span class="caps">MVC</span> I decided to give the framework known as Ruby on Rails a try. It has gained quite a lot of hype being open source (<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">github link</a>). I wanted to see whats the big fuss about so I gave it a try. I installed it on my system(s) and played around with it a little and what i saw would seem to be magic to a layman(offcourse if he had an IQ level that could understand how web applications work, which I doubt.).The framework was able to generate well structured applications with all the basic functions on the fly. <img src="http://rubyonrailsdevelopment.pl/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/rails-300x2313.png" class="right" alt="" /> I could run a command and generate a Model(you don&#8217;t know what a model is? Google it). I did not had to write a single piece of <span class="caps">SQL</span> code, my objects were persistant which means all the db level work was already taken care of. At some point I would ask myself &#8220;What sorcery is this?&#8221;. Yes, thats how good everything seemed. Changes I made to the code were reflected instantaneously. I learnt what it meant to be a Model, View and a Controller. Upon some further research I learnt that behind Rails is a philosophy. The philosophy has three points:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Thou shalt not repeat yourself. <acronym title="dont repeat yourself"><span class="caps">DRY</span></acronym>.</li>
	<li>Thou shalt believe in convention over configuration.</li>
	<li>Thou shalt follow the <acronym title="Representational State Transfer"><span class="caps">REST</span></acronym>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these three points Rails does what it does. Seeing Rails in action has allowed me to reach only one logical conclusion i.e it was created by the Vulcans. No other race is smart enough. If you are looking forward to learn some rails, <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">this</a> is a good place to start.</p>

				<a href="/web/2011/09/09/HTML5-and-CSS3-part1/">HTML5 and CSS3-getting on with it</a>
			</h1>
			<p>
				<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="html 5" src="http://www.w3.org/html/logo/downloads/HTML5_Logo_512.png" alt="" width="473" height="473" /></p>
<p>The world is changing and so is the Web. With <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 a lot of new elements have been added to the Markup.</p>
<p>This series of posts are here to help us get to know what changes does <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 bring to the game and how do we use and benefit from it. So lets get on with it. For part 1 of this series I am going to focus on the Semantic Tags which are absolutely basic parts of the <span class="caps">HTML</span> Document and explain the differences <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 has brought to them:<br />
<h3>The DocType Tag</h3><br />
Yes, its that strange piece of text on the top of a <span class="caps">HTML</span> Document and Developers like me have never been able to memorize it. We just copy paste it. This is what it looks like:<br />
<blockquote>&lt;!<span class="caps">DOCTYPE</span> html <span class="caps">PUBLIC</span> &#8220;-//W3C//<span class="caps">DTD</span> <span class="caps">HTML</span> 4.01 Transitional//EN&#8221; &#8220;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd&#8221;&gt;</blockquote><br />
Now that&#8217;s hard to remember i know, so html 5 has made it easy for us:<br />
<blockquote>&lt;!<span class="caps">DOCTYPE</span> html&gt;</blockquote><br />
<h3>The Header Tag</h3><br />
Yes, its a new tag in <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5. The specification describes it as &#8220;A group of introductory or navigational aid&#8221;. Normally this is how we used to create a header section:<br />
<blockquote>&lt;div id=&#8220;header&#8221;&gt;<br />
&lt;h1&gt;This is a header/h1&gt;<br />
&lt;/div&gt;</blockquote><br />
<span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 has made this even simple, by introducing a header tag:<br />
<blockquote>&lt;header&gt;<br />
&lt;h1This is the new header&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
&lt;/header&gt;</blockquote><br />
<h3>The Nav Tag</h3><br />
Another new addition is a nav tag. This tag is described as &#8220;A section of the page that links to other pages on the site or to other sections of that particular page&#8221;. Now we all remember how we used to create a bunch of navigational links inside an unordered list:<br />
<blockquote>&lt;div id=&#8220;navigation&#8221;&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;About/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Work&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Shop&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Contact&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;/div&gt;</blockquote><br />
<span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 introduces a nav tag to make this job more easier and html markup more readable:<br />
<blockquote>&lt;nav&gt;<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;About/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Work&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Shop&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Contact&lt;/li&gt;<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;/nav&gt;</blockquote><br />
<h3>The Section Tag</h3><br />
Just like the newly added nav and header tags, the section tag is used to divide the content into sections. It is described as &#8220;A grouping of content based around a theme&#8221;. Now sections are equivalent to what we would make from a div to represent different sections of our website for example:<br />
<blockquote>&lt;div id=&#8220;acc-news&#8221;&gt;<br />
&lt;h2&gt;<span class="caps">ACC</span> Basketball<br />
News&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
&lt;h3&gt;<span class="caps">UNC</span> Beats Duke in<br />
Champsionship Game!&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Devils are routed<br />
by the Tarheels at Cameron<br />
Indoor Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;/div&gt;</blockquote><br />
So <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 gives us a new tag to more conveniently organize the above markup:<br />
<blockquote>&lt;section&gt;<br />
&lt;header&gt;<br />
&lt;h1&gt;<span class="caps">ACC</span> Basketball News&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
&lt;/header&gt;<br />
&lt;h2&gt;<span class="caps">UNC</span> Beats Duke in Championship Game!<br />
&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Devils are routed by the Tarheels<br />
at Cameron Indoor Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;/section&gt;</blockquote><br />
<h3>The Article Tag</h3><br />
The Article tag can be used to divide the contents of a section in <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5. It is defined as &#8220;An independent, self-contained composition&#8221;. For example the markup in the previous heading can be re-written as:<br />
<blockquote>&lt;section&gt;<br />
&lt;header&gt;<br />
&lt;h1&gt;<span class="caps">ACC</span> Basketball<br />
News&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
&lt;/header&gt;<br />
&lt;article&gt;<br />
&lt;header&gt;<br />
&lt;h1&gt;<span class="caps">UNC</span> Beats Duke In<br />
Championship Game!<br />
&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
&lt;/header&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Devils are<br />
routed by the Tarheels at<br />
Cameron Indoor<br />
Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;/article&gt;<br />
&lt;/section&gt;</blockquote><br />
Now there are some interesting things to note here. See how the header tag is inside a section. Yes, this means you can add as many header tags inside your markup as you like. As you can see we have the news inside an article. This gives you a rough idea about how the article tags are used.<br />
<h3>The Aside Tag</h3><br />
The aside tag is described as &#8220;Content related to an article but not critical to its understanding&#8221;. The content inside the aside tag could be just some meta-data, some text thats not really important enough, example:<br />
<blockquote>&lt;article&gt;<br />
&lt;header&gt;<br />
&lt;h1&gt;<span class="caps">UNC</span> Beats Duke In<br />
Championship Game&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
&lt;/header&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Devils are routed by<br />
the Tarheels at Cameron Indoor<br />
Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;aside&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;Former Duke Players Cry at<br />
Game’s End&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;/aside&gt;<br />
&lt;/article&gt;</blockquote><br />
<h3>The Footer Tag</h3><br />
Just like the header tag, the footer tag is used at the end of a section. Its a special tag for what we would normally create from a div at the bottom of our web page. It is described as &#8220;Includes information that closes out a particular section.&#8221; We used to make a footer this way:<br />
<blockquote>&lt;div id=&#8220;footer&#8221;&gt;<br />
&lt;h3&gt;Talk to Me Goose&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&amp;copy; 2011 Maverick &amp;<br />
Goose Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;/div&gt;</blockquote><br />
And now with <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5:<br />
<blockquote>&lt;footer&gt;<br />
&lt;h3&gt;Talk to Me Goose&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
&lt;p&gt;&amp;copy; 2011 Maverick &amp;<br />
Goose Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
&lt;/footer&gt;</blockquote><br />
You see, how easy and fun <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 is. Offcourse there are some compatibility issues(same old story) I will be back with more posts on that, we will look at the canvas tag and finally some CSS3. Until then take care y&#8217;all I hope this post is helpful.</p>

			</h1>
			<p>
				<p>There is one thing I really thank God for and that is the modern day Web. The way information is available was once a <img class="right" title="Internet" src="http://picol.org/images/icons/files/png/128/internet_128.png" alt="" width="128" height="128" />dream. My Software Engineering Professor, who is an ex-Software Dev recalls that when they used to encounter a developer&#8217;s block, it was nearly impossible to find reference  or help like we do to today on the Internet. They had to go through manuals, books and talk to other experienced Devs who did not help easily. The world has changed now, information flows like the niagra falls. You can sit in your room, think about starting a business, in a couple of days do some R &amp; D and in a few weeks have a successful virtual business that not only ensures your financial security but also helps you network with other businesses. Offcourse luck is a big factor here.</p>
<p>So Thank you Web! For crawling out of your shell and making things easier. Also no thanks to you for turning most of my friends into couch potatoes.</p>
