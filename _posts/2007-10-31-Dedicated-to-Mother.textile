Here is a very sweet poem a fellow uetian wrote, dedicated to my mother:

I am going to Return to you Mother

And kiss your scented head

i will express all my eagerness

and sip the perfume of your right hand

i will put my cheek on the dust of your feet when i meet you

the soil will irrigate by my tears of happiness

when seeing you

Oh,how many nights you stayedawake to let me sleep deep

Oh,how long you stayed thirstyand quenched my thirst by your kindness

i dont forget your tears coming down like rain when i became ill

And you clouldnt close your eyes to sleep fearing a danger

might occur to me

And our farewell day at dawn was

the hardest dawn

I cant describe what i faced

because of your migration

I still remember

What you said to me that it is impossibleto find a heart

kinder than yours

your content is the secret of my success

and your love is glimpse of my faith

Your honest blessings relieved myhardsip and sorrows

No human being shares your love with me

You are pulse of my heart and you are lights

of my sight

I am going to return to you Mother

to have rest from travel

I havnt slept for a long time

U havnt kissed my cheek for a long time

I Cry in my room

When I know, this day

I will not see your face Again

I am going to return to you Mother

To sleep in yours arms
