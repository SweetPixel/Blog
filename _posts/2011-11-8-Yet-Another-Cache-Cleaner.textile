title: Yet Another Cache Cleaner
tagline: A cache cleaner for YAF
---

We installed <a href="http://www.yetanotherforum.net" target="_blank">yet another forum</a> on one of our private servers the past week. My job was to set it up the theme, smtp and access roles. So everything went well until I came to the most important requirement of them all:

The newly registered users were supposed to be in a very limited access role and once their identities were confirmed, the admin was to move them to full member access. This all was setup, but whenever I moved a user to full member access the account would still retain limited access of the first role assigned. This became annoying! So after a little googling I found out that there is cache inside YAF's db; a table called ActiveAccess. When you clear the table manually it resets the cache. There is a Stored Procedure as well "yaf_activeaccess_reset" for easier operation.

So I created a small utility that clears the cache after every four hours. Code Available here:

Its easy shneezy! Please not that this issue of cache not being cleared up is fixed in YAF version 1.9.6 BETA. But if you are  using 1.9.5 Stable you will have to do it manually or show patience for it to clear automatically(trust me, takes a while). Otherwise you can also run the utility i mentioned above.

Hope its helpful :)
