Research proves that people who have lesser choices have the most peace of mind.  On the other hand people who have lots of choices and find themselves confused within them, have more restless minds. However choices choices involved in creating computer software are a seperate story. There are a number of factors which have to be looked into before choosing the framework or language you will start coding in. I am not here to bore you with these factors, I am just trying to make a point about the restless/peaceful mind of the developer.

Developers who know how to create software using a number of platforms, are usually happy. They are sure that if one thing does not work they can try the other. These devs are jacks of all and masters of none. While devs who know only one platform are sometimes troubled by the limitations it has but it does not mean they are not happy. These people are uber devs in their platform of choice and if required functionality is not provided in it, they build it. Example? Cocoa's Async Socket library. Why? Because iOS did not have Socket Programming support by default. 

My point? Doesn't matter if you know one or a bazzillion platforms, if you have the motivation and dedication you will make it work somehow. Devs Rule!
