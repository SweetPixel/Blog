As 2011 comes to an end, I look back at it while sipping my tea. I see a pattern, a path, a plan becoming clearer. All the awesome movies are coming out in 2012 you know, The dark 
knight rises, Avengers and Spider-Man to name a few. They say the world might end as well, well if thats true I am gonna try to be sure to leave  a mark behind or build a nuke proof 
bunker for shelter. It might not be useful but it will be worth a try. Enough with the textbook narcissm, this post is for my friends and family to wish them a very happy new year. I 
hope and I  pray that may all of you may succeed in whatever plans you have for this year. Have a great 2012. Live long and prosper.
