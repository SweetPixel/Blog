Its been 2 years today. I have come a long way since You left, I wish I could tell You, Show you My achievements, the fruits of my hardwork. Wish I could tell you...how they all left me in one of the dark hours, the people you and I trusted the most.

I just wish wherever you are, you are happy...I miss you... thank you for everything...Father...
