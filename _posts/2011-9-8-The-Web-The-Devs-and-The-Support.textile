There is one thing I really thank God for and that is the modern day Web. The way information is available was once a <img class="right" title="Internet" src="http://picol.org/images/icons/files/png/128/internet_128.png" alt="" width="128" height="128" />dream. My Software Engineering Professor, who is an ex-Software Dev recalls that when they used to encounter a developer's block, it was nearly impossible to find reference  or help like we do to today on the Internet. They had to go through manuals, books and talk to other experienced Devs who did not help easily. The world has changed now, information flows like the niagra falls. You can sit in your room, think about starting a business, in a couple of days do some R &amp; D and in a few weeks have a successful virtual business that not only ensures your financial security but also helps you network with other businesses. Offcourse luck is a big factor here. 

So Thank you Web! For crawling out of your shell and making things easier. Also no thanks to you for turning most of my friends into couch potatoes.
