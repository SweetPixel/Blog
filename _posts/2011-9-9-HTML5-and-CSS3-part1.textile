The world is changing and so is the Web. With HTML 5 a lot of new elements have been added to the Markup.

This series of posts are here to help us get to know what changes does HTML 5 bring to the game and how do we use and benefit from it. So lets get on with it. For part 1 of this series I am going to focus on the Semantic Tags which are absolutely basic parts of the HTML Document and explain the differences HTML 5 has brought to them:
<h2>The DocType Tag</h2>
Yes, its that strange piece of text on the top of a HTML Document and Developers like me have never been able to memorize it. We just copy paste it. This is what it looks like:
<blockquote>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt;</blockquote>
Now that's hard to remember i know, so html 5 has made it easy for us:
<blockquote>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</blockquote>
<h2>The Header Tag</h2>
Yes, its a new tag in HTML 5. The specification describes it as "A group of introductory or navigational aid". Normally this is how we used to create a header section:
<blockquote>&lt;div id="header"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is a header/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</blockquote>
HTML 5 has made this even simple, by introducing a header tag:
<blockquote>&lt;header&gt;
&lt;h1This is the new header&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;</blockquote>
<h2>The Nav Tag</h2>
Another new addition is a nav tag. This tag is described as "A section of the page that links to other pages on the site or to other sections of that particular page". Now we all remember how we used to create a bunch of navigational links inside an unordered list:
<blockquote>&lt;div id="navigation"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</blockquote>
HTML 5 introduces a nav tag to make this job more easier and html markup more readable:
<blockquote>&lt;nav&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;</blockquote>
<h2>The Section Tag</h2>
Just like the newly added nav and header tags, the section tag is used to divide the content into sections. It is described as "A grouping of content based around a theme". Now sections are equivalent to what we would make from a div to represent different sections of our website for example:
<blockquote>&lt;div id="acc-news"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ACC Basketball
News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;UNC Beats Duke in
Champsionship Game!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Devils are routed
by the Tarheels at Cameron
Indoor Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</blockquote>
So HTML 5 gives us a new tag to more conveniently organize the above markup:
<blockquote>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ACC Basketball News&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UNC Beats Duke in Championship Game!
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Devils are routed by the Tarheels
at Cameron Indoor Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</blockquote>
<h2>The Article Tag</h2>
The Article tag can be used to divide the contents of a section in HTML 5. It is defined as "An independent, self-contained composition". For example the markup in the previous heading can be re-written as:
<blockquote>&lt;section&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ACC Basketball
News&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;article&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;UNC Beats Duke In
Championship Game!
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Devils are
routed by the Tarheels at
Cameron Indoor
Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</blockquote>
Now there are some interesting things to note here. See how the header tag is inside a section. Yes, this means you can add as many header tags inside your markup as you like. As you can see we have the news inside an article. This gives you a rough idea about how the article tags are used.
<h2>The Aside Tag</h2>
The aside tag is described as "Content related to an article but not critical to its understanding". The content inside the aside tag could be just some meta-data, some text thats not really important enough, example:
<blockquote>&lt;article&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;UNC Beats Duke In
Championship Game&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Devils are routed by
the Tarheels at Cameron Indoor
Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Duke Players Cry at
Gameâ€™s End&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;</blockquote>
<h2>The Footer Tag</h2>
Just like the header tag, the footer tag is used at the end of a section. Its a special tag for what we would normally create from a div at the bottom of our web page. It is described as "Includes information that closes out a particular section." We used to make a footer this way:
<blockquote>&lt;div id="footer"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Talk to Me Goose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;copy; 2011 Maverick &amp;
Goose Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</blockquote>
And now with HTML 5:
<blockquote>&lt;footer&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Talk to Me Goose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;copy; 2011 Maverick &amp;
Goose Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;</blockquote>
You see, how easy and fun HTML 5 is. Offcourse there are some compatibility issues(same old story) I will be back with more posts on that, we will look at the canvas tag and finally some CSS3. Until then take care y'all I hope this post is helpful.
