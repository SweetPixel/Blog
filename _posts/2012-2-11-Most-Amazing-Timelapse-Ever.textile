title: Most Amazing Timelapse of the Universe ever
category: Thoughts
---
I came across this beautiful timelapse video on vimeo. It has deeply inspired me. The way the original creator of the video has captured our universe is very unique. The way you can see the whole galaxy move is so soothing that its easy for the watcher to get deeply immersed in the experience. Boy, I am gonna buy a telescope for star gazing.

Here is the video:

All credit goes to the original creator of this video. Enjoy!
