!(left)/images/the_cake_is_a_lie_515.jpg!*Happy Birthday* Ali old boy. Yes, today is my 25th Birthday. I have been looking back at the time and my achievements. I have been thinking, Am I really happy with all this? The answer is a bit confusing but I can see that today I have come to the point where I am forced to think over all my priorities and what I want to do. I want to something big, I want to do something that makes me happy. Its time I start re-thinking life and start doing what I want rather than letting events or people drive me.

I cannot share anymore thoughts on this at the moment but All I know for now is that I just want to be happy :)
