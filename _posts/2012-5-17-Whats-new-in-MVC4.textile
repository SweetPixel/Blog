It's been a couple of days that I am playing with MVC4 in my free time. I installed Visual Studio 11 Beta for the Web as soon as it came out, but never really got the chance to check it out properly. We had a power outage today for like 7 hours which and I had no Internets(yes I like to call it Internets, its not a Typo) which gave me time to check out MVC4 and I have one word for it, Cheese Omellete. Ok thats two words but thats how MVC4 made me feel, a healthy and delicious breakfast recipe. So here is a little breakdown of the new features of MVC4:

h2. ASP.NET Web API

Sounds cool doesn't it. A framework that can create HTTP Services that work on any client, be it mobile or web browser. It also makes it dead simple to write REST Service. Do give this one a try, you will be making web services better than you grandpa ever could. Some of it's features are:

* Modern HTTP Programming Model.
* Full Support for Routes(Yes works pretty much like Rails now).
* Content
