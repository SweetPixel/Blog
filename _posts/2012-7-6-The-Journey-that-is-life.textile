!(right)http://fuuu.us/389.png! There was a time some 3-4 years back when I never blogged about tech. That was a time I just blogged whatever went through my head. This blog post is kind sorta typa(I know one of the readers who will say "There is no such word as typa") like that. I see we live in strange times where humor is found in Internet Memes or TV Shows which have laugh tracks to tell us when to explode into laughter. Today you may have a thousand friends on Facebook but none in real life, today you know where your friends check-in to eat, but you forget where they used to live. Today its easy to hold a grudge and extremely difficult to forgive(I prefer the later though). 

I have seen things and people change in front of my eyes, for better and for worse. The ones you mostly expect to have your back are usually the ones who stab you first and vice versa. But thats not my point. Imagine you fall upon a time machine that allows you to go back in time to the one cherished memory you have that seems to give you hope all the time. Some would prefer to use it to take revenge, while some like me would prefer to spend a few moments with our parents back in time. Now thats the problem! We dont see life as a journey we think of it as a phase, a collection of memories and a never-ending fear of uncertainity. Wake up people life is just a journey, things and people are suppose to change, move on and if possible dont ever change(for worse) beacause its you who will make a difference in the end for yourself. Rock on!
