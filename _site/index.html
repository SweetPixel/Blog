    		<p>Research proves that people who have lesser choices have the most peace of mind.  On the other hand people who have lots of choices and find themselves confused within them, have more restless minds. However choices choices involved in creating computer software are a seperate story. There are a number of factors which have to be looked into before choosing the framework or language you will start coding in. I am not here to bore you with these factors, I am just trying to make a point about the restless/peaceful mind of the developer.</p>
<p>Developers who know how to create software using a number of platforms, are usually happy. They are sure that if one thing does not work they can try the other. These devs are jacks of all and masters of none. While devs who know only one platform are sometimes troubled by the limitations it has but it does not mean they are not happy. These people are uber devs in their platform of choice and if required functionality is not provided in it, they build it. Example? Cocoa&#8217;s Async Socket library. Why? Because iOS did not have Socket Programming support by default.</p>
<p>My point? Doesn&#8217;t matter if you know one or a bazzillion platforms, if you have the motivation and dedication you will make it work somehow. Devs Rule!</p>

    		<p>There was a time when my blog used to run on Wordpress. I love Wordpress, its plugins, its themes and the overall simplicity but my problem is I am like a rolling stone I never settle for one thing, I keep on moving to better and better, no matter how complex things become.</p>
<p>Being a geek has taught me one thing, do not do what everybody else does. So following this thought i learned about Jekyll from <a href="http://www.destroytoday.com" target="blank">Johnny Hallman&#8217;s Blog</a>. Instantly I knew I had to give this a try. With my new found love for Rails applications, this surely has proven to be a delight. So I am moving my blog from Wordpress <span class="caps">CMS</span> to plain <span class="caps">HTML</span> with the help of Jekyll. The thing is that any framework or tool that gives you complete control over your rendered <span class="caps">HTML</span> is super awesome in my opinion, which is another reason I love working with Asp.net mvc3 and Rails but with Jekyll my blog becomes <span class="caps">HTML</span> hence saving me a lot of time and effort, no complex logic involved. Give <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> a try, trust me you will not regret it.</p>

    		<p>Today I moved this blog to a personal <span class="caps">VPS</span> at linode. I feel a significant performance increase. I have grown very fond of linode, it was I must say it was fun to configure a <span class="caps">LAMP</span> stack, and then moving my blog here from wordpress.com. While I was at it I also installed the Rails framework(which I haven&#8217;t tested yet). <a href="http://www.linode.com"><img class="alignleft" title="linode" src="http://www.linode.com/images/linode_logo_gray.png" alt="" width="288" height="65" /></a>The overall experience has been very knowledgeable. I thought it will be a pain to set everything up but thanks to the extensive documentation and an amazing community it turned out to be a piece of cake. Also its <span class="caps">VPS</span> so does not occupy space meaning cleaner greener environment. I would write more but I am too tired. I am happy and feel like a newly turned vegan so I am gonna leave you with a video I happen to like. Cheers</p>

<h2><a href="/.Net framework/2011/11/08/Yet-Another-Cache-Cleaner/">Yet Another Cache Cleaner</a></h2>
<br />
<blockquote>Posted on 08 Nov 2011</blockquote>
  	<div class="content">
    		<p>We installed <a href="http://www.yetanotherforum.net" target="_blank">yet another forum</a> on one of our private servers the past week. My job was to set it up the theme, smtp and access roles. So everything went well until I came to the most important requirement of them all:</p>
<p>The newly registered users were supposed to be in a very limited access role and once their identities were confirmed, the admin was to move them to full member access. This all was setup, but whenever I moved a user to full member access the account would still retain limited access of the first role assigned. This became annoying! So after a little googling I found out that there is cache inside YAF&#8217;s db; a table called ActiveAccess. When you clear the table manually it resets the cache. There is a Stored Procedure as well &#8220;yaf_activeaccess_reset&#8221; for easier operation.</p>
<p>So I created a small utility that clears the cache after every four hours. Code Available here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/aliirz/YAFCacheCleaner" target="_blank">https://github.com/aliirz/YAFCacheCleaner</a></p>
<p>Its easy shneezy! Please not that this issue of cache not being cleared up is fixed in <span class="caps">YAF</span> version 1.9.6 <span class="caps">BETA</span>. But if you are  using 1.9.5 Stable you will have to do it manually or show patience for it to clear automatically(trust me, takes a while). Otherwise you can also run the utility i mentioned above.</p>
<p>Hope its helpful :)</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" title="rails" src="http://www.ajaxline.com/files/rorlogo.png" alt="" width="316" height="402" />After having a few adventures with <span class="caps">PHP</span> and Asp.net <span class="caps">MVC</span> I decided to give the framework known as Ruby on Rails a try. It has gained quite a lot of hype being open source (<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">github link</a>). I wanted to see whats the big fuss about so I gave it a try. I installed it on my system(s) and played around with it a little and what i saw would seem to be magic to a layman(offcourse if he had an IQ level that could understand how web applications work, which I doubt.).</p>
<p>The framework was able to generate well structured applications with all the basic functions on the fly. I could run a command and generate a Model(you don&#8217;t know what a model is? Google it). I did not had to write a single piece of <span class="caps">SQL</span> code, my objects were persistant which means all the db level work was already taken care of. At some point I would ask myself &#8220;What sorcery is this?&#8221;. Yes, thats how good everything seemed. Changes I made to the code were reflected instantaneously. I learnt what it meant to be a Model, View and a Controller.</p>
<p>Upon some further research I learnt that behind Rails is a philosophy. The philosophy has three points:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Thou shalt not repeat yourself. <acronym title="dont repeat yourself"><span class="caps">DRY</span></acronym>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Thou shalt believe in convention over configuration.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Thou shalt follow the <acronym title="Representational State Transfer"><span class="caps">REST</span></acronym>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these three points Rails does what it does. Seeing Rails in action has allowed me to reach only one logical conclusion i.e it was created by the Vulcans. No other race is smart enough.</p>
<p>If you are looking forward to learn some rails, <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">this</a> is a good place to start.</p>
