I love working with APIs. I develop applications on iOS, Rails and .NET 
framework. I Graduated from <a href="http://www.nwfpuet.edu.pk" target="blank">UET Peshawar</a> and work with a UK based softwar company called <a href="http://www.welltime.co.uk" target="blank">Welltime Ltd.

Like every other Geek I am a huge fan of Sci-Fi and Video 
cGames.  I like to hack-up totally 
unnecessary projects often, for example a small utility that reminds me to Get Latest version of Code from the TFS repository whenever I fire up Visual Studio or a small <a
