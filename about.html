<strong>Ali Raza</strong>
<br />
I am a <strong>Software Dev+Hacker</strong> from Pakistan. I create mobile and web applications and have a passion for research.<img class="alignright" src="/images/ali_raza.jpg"/ width="297.5" height="360"/> I love working with APIs. I develop applications on iOS, Rails and .NET framework. I Graduated from <a href="http://www.nwfpuet.edu.pk" target="blank">UET Peshawar</a> and work with a UK based software company called <a href="http://www.welltime.co.uk" target="blank">Welltime Ltd. UK</a>. I have help build two of the major projects of Welltime called <a href="http://www.appointmentor.com" target="blank">Appointmentor</a> and <a href="http://www.patientconnections.co.uk" target="blank">Patient Connections</a>.  Like every other Geek I am a huge fan of Sci-Fi and Video Games.  I like to hack-up totally simple yet helpful projects often, for example a small utility that reminds me to Get Latest version of Code from the TFS repository whenever I fire up Visual Studio or a small <a href="https://github.com/aliirz/YAFCacheCleaner" target="blank">Cache Cleaner</a> for YetAnotherForum. I love Rock  music, from classics like Guns n Roses and Nirvana to MCR and Fountains of Wayne. Lets see what else, Oh I am a caffeine lover and enjoy staring for long periods of time into the abyss.
