		<h1>Ali Raza</h1>
		<p><img class="left" style="width: 512px;height:512px" src="/images/ali.jpeg" align="ME"/>My name is Ali Raza. I am a software developer from Pakistan. I create mobile and web applications and have a passion for research. I love working with APIs. I develop applications on iOS, Rails and .NET framework. Like every other Geek I am a huge fan of Sci-Fi and Video Games. I like to hack-up totally simple yet helpful projects often, for example a small utility that reminds me to Get Latest version of Code from the TFS repository whenever I fire up Visual Studio or a small Cache Cleaner for YetAnotherForum. I love Rock music, from classics like Guns n Roses and Nirvana to MCR and Fountains of Wayne. Lets see what else, Oh I am a caffeine lover and enjoy staring for long periods of time into the abyss. </p>
