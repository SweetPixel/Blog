It began at LUMS two years ago when I made up my mind what I really wanted to do in my life. I saw great examples of doers, people who were making a difference and some who were legends. I saw strangers coming together to solve a problem, to change the world and to launch what would become their ultimate achievement in life. That was the day I knew I was an entrepreneur. After coming back from Lahore I tried igniting the same passion around me. I was often told that it will not work but I was very patient and consistent and today as a result I work on my own bootstrapped startup now. I know I still have a long journey ahead, but I feel confident now that it will be worth it from what I have witnessed today.

I felt an amazing energy, a powerful display of motivation and absolute faith in ideas in the past three days on "Startup Weekend Peshawar":http://peshawar.startupweekend.org/.
