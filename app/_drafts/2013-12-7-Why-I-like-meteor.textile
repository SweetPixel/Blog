I came across meteor when it was on version 0.0.1. At that moment I knew its going to be a promising framework, call it a hunch or call it a developer's perception, I knew what I was looking at is going to be great. It pleases me to see that meteor has grown into a very robust efort with its applications in the "Enterprise":https://www.discovermeteor.com/2013/10/15/meteor-enterprise-scoutzie-dashboard/ as well
