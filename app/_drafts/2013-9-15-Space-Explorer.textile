We would be lying if any of us said that we have never wondered what lies beyond the cosmos. We would be lying if we were to say that we have looked at the glistening stars in the dark of the night and never wondered if we could ever reach one. My dear readers admit it or not we all share the fascination with deep space. While the age old question "Are we alone?" remains unanswered, why is it that whenever we are under the open sky at night we "do" look up and wonder about the massive galaxy even if it is for a few seconds. 

The answer is very simple, there is a space explorer in all of us. I have never met a soul who is not interested in learning or sharing knowledge about space.
