I sit near your final resting place. trying to remember everything you said, you did, your smiles, the way you were…even your last days…i look upon my life and the way it connected with you. i remember the time you used to come back from work and the way i used to hug you, the way you took me in your arms when i was a little boy. the way you used to tell me right and wrong, the things i learnt from your wisdom. the way you always appeared a king to me.

I miss everything about you…not a single moment of my life is spent without me thinking about you…feeling the physical hole left in my life never filling up…just like the hole in my heart…i wish i was stronger in emotions like you…i wish i was a better son too…i really miss you…

Then in the silence, all of a sudden a cool breeze touches me…I feel it filled with your love and affection, it feels like a gentle touch on my shoulders…whispering to me that all is not lost and i get to see that you still live in me dad, you left your soul in us…you might not have a physical existence around me dad but i know you are there watching, listening and smiling...i am proud to be your son…
