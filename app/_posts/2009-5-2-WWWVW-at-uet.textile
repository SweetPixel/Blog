Every year Sun Microsystems arrange a  Volunteer week, this year they took the initiative to make it a global event and involve the student community using their OSUM (Open Source University Meetup) platform. As my university has a newly established  OSUM we also participated  by arranging an introductory presentation on OSUM and SAI ( you've got to start from somewhere)

The event was then finalized for the April

28th Tuesday and since the Auditorium was still booked we used the university's video conference room. The presentation began at exactly 10:30 AM.  the attendees which included faculty members and students were given CDs, bags and Lapel Pins from Sun Microsystems.

Demos were given to students explaining on how to register and be a part of OSUM and SAI. Our university is currently the second in NWFP to have an OSUM group and the first to introduce SAI to the students. It was a wonderful experience for everyone and it was great to see so many students share our passion for FOSS and changing the world through it.

We have a Fully dedicated Sun Lab which is based on a Sun V240 Server and Sunray 2 thin clients and we look forward to use it for our next event which will be a Netbeans handson.

<p style="text-align: left;">The event was fun and a great way to introduce OSUM to the students and faculty members and its cool features. We look upon a bright and prosperous future for everyone as long as OSUMs are there :)</p>
