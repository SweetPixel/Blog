My buddies are  working on Lego Mindstorms NXT this year. with a tougher floor plan than last time and an even tougher goal, I decided to help them out with a small program that proved to be very useful to me last year.

<img class="size-full wp-image-124" title="Degree Measurer" src="http://dejavu87.wordpress.com/files/2009/07/measure.jpg" alt="NXT" width="454" height="259" />

This program actually measures the rotations of a motor. all the user has to do is hold the NXT in one hand and a motor connected to it in the other. Running the motor by hand on the floor plan shows the degrees of rotation on the NXT's Screen.

So here it is guys. May this help you with all the NERC's. and may we Win this year. Amen.
