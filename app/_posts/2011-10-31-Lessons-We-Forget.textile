title: Lessons We Forget
category: Thoughts

We learn so many things in life from the greatest of teachers, yet they seem to become inapplicable or simply don’t come in our shallow minds when needed. Be it a valuable lesson you learn from a fight you had, or something you learnt by simply watching a little insect trying to climb a wall desperately, or some valuable piece of words otherwise known as sentence shining like gold spoken by somebody’s mouth or read from a book. Our deep lost in logic minds cant think of the logic of these lessons whenever needed. so called think tanks we are… We become what we do all day. We do things sometimes so brutal so unexpected that our hearts fill with guilt and sorrow. sometimes its our past experience with people and in some cases its our deepest darkest secret we cant afford to recall at any cost. What we forget is that we already have the arsenal to overcome any grief, fear or simply a panic attack. in the form of valuable lessons. life has been and will always prepare us for the things to come…al we have to do is have faith, believe and keep our hearts and minds free..
