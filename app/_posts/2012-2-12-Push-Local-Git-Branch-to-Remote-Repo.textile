Title: Push a Local Git Branch to Remote Repository
category: Git
keywords: git branch push origin
---
This post is for those who are new to the Git System. I am going to show how to create a new branch of a git repo, push it to remote repo and finally check it out on another machine.

The first thing, create a new branch based on an existing branch with the following command:

{% highlight bash %}git checkout - b 'New-Branch' {% endhighlight %}

The above command creates and switches to the newly created branch.

Then this is how you push it to the remote repository:

{% highlight bash %}git push origin New-Branch {% endhighlight %}

All set, the newly created branch has been pushed to the remote repository. Now how will we access it on another System? Thats easy too, the first thing that needs to be done on the other system is:

{% highlight bash %}git fetch origin {% endhighlight %}

This will update the repo with the changes from remote repo. But wait this will not add the newly created branch yet, note that it has been fetched but is not being tracked yet. To do that we use the following command:

{% highlight bash %}git checkout --track origin/New-Branch {% endhighlight %}

Yes, thats it. Hope this post will help someone. Cheers.
