I have never seen so many entrepreneurs under one roof ever in my life. I always wanted to to go to one of them techcrunch's disrupts to meet with others like me and network. I never imagined I would get the chance to attend an even more awesome event in my own country.

It was a last minute decision to attend this amazing event in Lahore. What I hadthought to be a simple participation turned into an energy-filled, nerve wrenching hackathon 54-hours straight. I will be very honest I had never thought of writing so much code in a day and that too in a simple text editor.

Launching a startup was not the only reason we attended the event. The other reason was networking and getting the chance to meet big names from the Industry in Pakistan. All those seniors became mentors and helped each and every participant build the best project. I too became acquaninted to very inspirtation people like Afaque Ahmed from Breezecom, Raza Saeed from Confez Solutions and Saj Khan from Scrybe. Not only that but I found good friends as well like Junaid Atique, Kamil Waheed and Jaiser Abbas. 

If there is a "startup weekend":http://startupweekend.org/ coming up near where you live, I totally recommend checking it out. You will not be sorry! 

It was a very energetic event and it opened a whole new world for me. I am so looking forward to take over the world piece-by-piece ;)
