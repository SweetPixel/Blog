I know it sucks that the Raspberry Pi does not come with a built-in wifi receiver.if you are like me and would like to be free from cables, then follow the instructions and this guide to quickly have your Pi over Wi-fi. You will need the following:

Thats a Raspberry by in a very solid "casing":http://uniquegadgets.com.pk/Raspberry-Pi-Cyntech-Blackberry-Raspberry-Pi-Case-in-Pakistan and a TP-Link WN823N Mini Wireless USB Adapter which works out of the box with Raspberry Pi. The Pi is running Raspbian Wheezy installed on a 16GB SD Card. Now lets get to business. 

h4. Connect your Pi to you A.P/Router via LAN Cable

The image above pretty much sums it up doesn't it?

h4. SSH into your Pi

Now find out the IP of your Raspberry PI(Hint: DHCP table on your Router's configuration page) and SSH into it. If done right you will see the following screen:

h4. Configuring Wifi

Plugin the USB Wifi dongle into the Raspberry PI and edit the *wpa_supplicant.conf* file located at:
{% highlight bash %}
/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
{% endhighlight %}

You must add these lines to the file:

{% highlight bash %}
network={
  ssid="YOUR_SSID"
  psk="YOUR_WPA_KEY"
}
{% endhighlight %}

That's it! Save the file, disconnect the LAN Cable, Restart your PI and enjoy the freedom you just obtained.

For those of you interested, I got the raspberry pi and the casing from "Unique Gadgets":http://www.uniquegadgets.com.pk. Give them a shoutout so that they continue their amazing service.
