I came across "meteor":http://www.meteor.com when it was on version 0.0.1. At that moment I knew its going to be a promising framework, call it a hunch or call it a developer's perception, I knew what I was looking at is going to be great. It pleases me to see that meteor has grown into a very robust efort with its applications in the "Enterprise":https://www.discovermeteor.com/2013/10/15/meteor-enterprise-scoutzie-dashboard/ as well. You will hear from a lot of people saying that meteor is not ready yet for high developing high end apps. Given below is a list of reasons why I think meteor is going to be the next big thing.

h3. DDP

I absolutely love the "distributed data protol":http://www.meteor.com/blog/2012/03/21/introducing-ddp behind meteor. It eliminates the need to query the server side constantly for data by creating a cache on the client side and having the server push data on the wire from a canonical data source. Now note that its only data that is pushed and its upto the client that however way it wants to render it which makes it a lot more efficient.

h3. Freedom of Structure

You are free to structure your code in any way you want, once you deploy or build it all gets concatenated into a single file. No longer developers have to worry about following convention or workflows. In fact they are free to make their own workflow or convention.

h3. Realtime & Hot Code Pushes

Oh yes, this is my favourite. Meteor is realtime and websocket enabled out of the box, means that upon new shared data between multiple clients the UI updates automatically. You dont have to write a single line of code to wire it up. Although to configure channels as to make sure no unauthorized data is accessed by the wrong client, you will have to implement your own channels.

The other thing-a-magick feature that must be mentioned here is the hot code push. Meteor has the ability to store session information and update the complete app while the user is using it as soon as you publish an update. The update is so seamless that it's almost crazy.

h3. Smart Packages

Meteor comes with a good number of smart packages which make development even faster. Notable of these are the the bootstrap package to quickly create your apps UI with Twitter Bootstrap or the iron-router which allows you to define routes just like you would do in a rails app.

h3. The Community

The community around Meteor reminds me of the earl"y days of Ruby on Rails. People are building amazing things using meteor for example "telescope":http://telesc.pe/ which is an open source hacker news clone and "PiJS":http://pijs.io/ a cloud based javascrip code deployment tool that can be used to program your Raspberry Pi(Blog post coming soon). These are just two of the many examples you can find on the Internet. 

h3. Final Words

To me meteor is a framework that has revolutionized the way we build web apps. Not only its open source and easy to extend, it has a passionate community that wants to make it as good as any other web framework out there. This is all from me for now, I am still learning meteor and looking forward to create some experimental apps to play with. Expect more from where this post came from dear reader.
