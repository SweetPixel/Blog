!(img-responsive centreThis img-rounded)/images/Benefits-of-Swimming.jpg!I'll admit, my mind no longer works the same way as it used to work 4 years ago. I have now a lot to do, lot to think and lot to plan. Things have not been easy but every step has shaped me into someone I would not want to mess with if I had met him 5 years ago. My problem has always been putting others in front of me, thankfully now that i have recognized it I no longer fear outcomes, I feel like a doer. The mantra I follow is to "just keep swimming".

Life has the habit of beating you down, the more you expect the more you get hurt. So instead of expecting things just "do" and move on. If its supposed to work its gonna happen otherwise it was worth a try. All I am trying to say is that don't let anything stop you from doing what you have always wanted to do. There can be hurdles but you can always cross them. Your life might become difficult for some time, but the rest of it will be spent in the joy of knowing you lived it the way you always wanted to. Rock On!
