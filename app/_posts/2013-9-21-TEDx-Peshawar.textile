So here I am attending TEDx Peshawar, and what a splendid opportunity it is to blog about it. The event has been organized by a great team lead by Uzair Khattak who was kind enough to let me be one of the organizers as well:

There are a lot of people here, even more than I was expecting. The turnout is quite big it appears and it really shows how the youth is interested in sharing and learning ideas. There are some very good speakers here too from different fields and it appears that we are about to learn a lot from their talks. The team has just finished preparing the stage which looks amazing as it is showcasing our culture, MASH productions have begun photographing and the projector is finally all set up.

The hosts have now taken the stage and are explaining the idea behind TED. The male host is a funny guy, he is energetic as well and makes jokes to light up the mood.

The first talk is about to begin, a lot of energy and excitement can be felt throughout the hall. *Dr. Salma* the Director of Pastho Academy is about to take the stage as the first speaker. Dr. Salma has begun her talk by reading from her book about folk songs.

Her words have mesmerized the audience. She quoted the famous Pushto Song "Lar Sha Pekhawar Ta" and is explaining how professional the lyrics are. She is explainig how the songs are a complete story in themselves. I have heard these songs numerous times but it never occured to me that how deep the meaning has been. The audience is simply speechless at this moment, the collective feeling is unexplaninable in words. Her talk is over and she left the audience mesmerized.

The next speaker is Muhammad Akhund who is a historian and writer.

I helped him prepare his slides, he has some great photographs of Peshawar city he wants to showcase. He is explaining the historical importance of Peshawar and its architecture. He adds that how we have destroyed what once used to be a center of cultural treasure. He says that the work that supposed to be done by gold craftsmen was handed out to iron workers.

The next speaker is Mr. Joudat Ayaz who is the secretary of education of KP.

His talk is titled KP 7.0. He is talking about the initiatives the government is taking for promoting education. He is sharing some statistics about the education department of KP and I am surprised to learn that there are some 27000 teachers in the whole province and some 3.9 million school going children. He is sharing the problems that schools are facing and what the government is planning to do about them. He is sharing the governemnt's plan to create a healthier education environment. He is sharing some ideas about how we can improve the conditions. His idea is to have people donate to a school's development. He is also talking about a system like Khan Academy that can provide virtual and free education. He says that the governemnt is building a sms based complaint system for under developed areas of KPK. "We are dreaming to build a better KP and we want all of you to help" with these motivational words he finished his talk. 

The next speaker is Amir Anzur who happens to be a Webpreneur.

He is the dean of Webpreneur Academy which is a virtual initiative that helps people start business over the Internet. He is stressing the importance of dreams and living them up. He is sharing how can anyone live up to their dreams. Amir says that the first thing is to "break your dream down into steps and take one step at a time".  The second thing is "little things lead to bigger things". The third thing is that "A six is a nine" which means that things are not what they may always seem. A truly amazing talk beautifully executed. 

The next speaker is Muhammad Asif who I know personally, we have met on numerous occasions and I consider him a mentor.

Asif has been a source of inspiration for me from a very long time and right now I can see how he is inspiring others with the story about his entrepreneurial success. He is talking about how he went to US on a scholarship and got the inspiration to start his own company there. That how he came back to Pakistan and struggled as a entrepreneur. He is now a successful entrepreneur and his company's tools are used by hundred's of brands like Google and Microsoft to name a few. Asif's words are very inspiring as he is motivating budding entrepreneurs not to give up and show persistance in their struggle.

The next speaker is Dr. Usman who is an expert on health policy and management.

Usman is talking how he was disappointed about the health system of our country and how he decided to pursue fixing it. He is emphasizing the importance of electronic health records. He is telling how the drug prescriptions are written on paper in Pakistan and how poor the quality is. In his study he found that on most of these prescriptions there is no diagnosis, no drug dose, no idea about the duration of the usage and surprisingly there was no physician reg. no. He is working on an idea about a sms based prescription. Its a great idea.

So I am back from a tea break, had two samosas and a cup of tea like gentlemen do. The event is about to resume did I mention its very hot here? Thankfully the Air Conditioners are working. 

The next speaker is Muneeb Khawaja who is a software engineer.

He says he is no entrepreneur, he is just passionate about technology and learning. He is showing how to redefine yourselves. He is talking about how people have gained success. "Internet has made everything global" he says. He is showing the audience how open education and knowledge have become. He is telling his story about how he gained his clients by creating a web presence for himself. He is giving examples how people have achieved their dream jobs by showing their passion about them on the Internet. 

The stage is about to be taken by twin brothers Asad and Jamshaid who are musicians. Everyone is extremely excited to listen to some music after an amazing series of talks. My cell phone's battery has run out so I have to improvise and use my macbook's camera. Here is a video of their performance(sorry for the bad quality):

After this amazing performance the audience members are being invited to share their ideas. This is called the pitch session. I am surprised to see college students on the stage, such confidencne and clarity in presenting their ideas. 

So the event has come to an end. My buddy Usman joined me at the end as I was an organizer. I have received a delicious cupcake as well:
