I have been slowly working the past few months completely revamping my blog. Although I liked the grid based design the blog had previously which looked something like this:

I felt as if that my blog wasn't focusing enough on what was important i.e. content. So I decided to look into a new design and one thing lead to another, the result is in front of you. I would like to highlight whats new and the things I have learnt on this long journey.

h2. Under The Hood

Let me begin with what is it that is making the whole blog tick. Its nothing, except *HTML5* and *CSS3*. The glue that is holding it all together is the popular static site generator "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com but instead of using jekyll simply, I am using a "yeoman":http://yeoman.io generator to have a more "streamlined workflow"::https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb.

My blog is now powered by numerous node modules that "grunt":http://gruntjs.com runs in order to minify, concat and deploy my blog's content. I am using "bower":http://bower.io for package managment making sure that all packages I am using are up to date and stable versions.

h2. New Logo

My blog now fashions its own logo:

The logo represents the intellectual nature of a geek's head. Wired up on technology, using science and creativity to answer the world's problems. The inspiration came from the theory of "left and right brains":http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/a/left-brain-right-brain.htm which states that we use the left side to solve and think over maths or science while the right side is more creative and that is where art or design comes from.

h2. New Design

The interface has been completely re-designed with "Bootstrap v3.0":http://getbootstrap.com . If you recall my earlier design used "Foundation":http://foundation.zurb.com which itself is a great CSS framework but working with bootstrap from a very long time now I feel accustomed to it's grid and other features so deciding on Bootstrap as the CSS framework to use was a no brainer at all. I also added some UI goodness via CSS3 transitions and animations. Oh and its responsive:

h2. Minimalism

My blog is now focusing more on minimalism which has become my mantra towards achieving goals these days and I am planning to live life by that as well. I find solace and peace in simplicity and same goes for minimal user experiences. One aspect I really enjoy of minimalistc design is the typography, that is why I have chosen to give more focus to typefaces in the new design rather than images or other UI goodness.

h2. Final Words

Do give me some feedback if you read this, if there is anything you would like to know about this design iteration or see anything that can be improved, please share it in the comments below. As always all my code is availbale on "github":http://github.com/aliirz for the world to fork and play with. If you do use anything from my code please remember to pay it forward and I would appreciate if you link back here(not mandatory btw).
