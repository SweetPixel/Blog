As most of you know Plan9 is a platform for young entrepreneurs(like moi) to present and get help turn their ideas into a reality. Its a pretty sweet deal once your get shortlisted; they give you an office at Arfa Software Technology Park, Mentorship, Rs. 20K monthly stripend to each member of your team and six months to complete the project. Seriously its worth it, too bad you are gonna wait till the next time its announced as all deadlines have ended. More information on their <a href="http://plan9.pitb.gov.pk/">website.</a></p><p>I received an email on Friday after prayers that we had been selected to attend Plan9 Islamabad to pitch our idea so on a very short notice me and my buddies arranged accomodation/travel as the event was to take place tomorrow i.e. Saturday. Once we reached our Hotel we had dinner and prepared our pitch. We brought our best idea and we knew it was too good to say no to. It was a game we had been working on from quite some time now(more on that later) but again this post is not about the idea its about the experience. So where was I? Oh yes we had a good night sleep and went to Comsats islamabad the next day for initial pitches. The event started a bit late(the story of Pakistan, the participants showed up late). Anyhow the first batch of pitches started, we were told that some 200 people had applied and only 30 made it here. That boosted our confidence to a ninja level. Then came the time to present the idea in front of the judges. Yeah the judges, what we did not know that the pioneer of the gaming industry in Pakistan Mr. <a href="http://twitter.com/sheryhydri">Shehryar Hydri</a> will be presiding there. We were already starting to lose some sweat but as soon as we gave our first pitch I had a hunch that guys no matter what happens we are clearing the first shortlisting round today, my partner&#8217;s however had mixed opinions. Anyways we did get shortlisted among four others from the total of thirty applicants(I was right). Then started the mentoring session which was the real eye-opener for me. We spent some good two hours talking to different mentors who were there for us and we refined our idea with the help of Shery Bhai, Mr. Syed and other mentors. What we really enjoyed was the mentoring session by Shery Bhai who like an elder experienced brother made us realize that we brought the wrong idea to the table here. We quickly realized that we might not make it any further which made us learn the first lesson:</p><p><strong>Don&#8217;t bring an AK47 to a Knife fight.</strong></p><p><img src="/images/from-plan9/bf1d.mateen-usman.jpeg" class=right alt="">So this was the end of the first day, at the end of which I suffered from the worst headache ever, took two pills of aspirin and it was good night Pakistan for me. Then comes in the final pitch day a.k.a the reckoning. We woke up pretty early and started working on the presentation in the hotel. Once done we made our way to the university and got some final mentoring from Shery Bhai. Deep in our hearts we knew this was the end of it, we are not going to make it any further and probably never end up sitting in Arfa Software Technology park but we went along with it anyway. We gave our final pitch, tried the best we could. At one point we were asked could we name one female who takes care of her home and will play the game we are building and all of a sudden the first woman who came in my mind was The awesome <a href="http://pakimom.wordpress.com">Miss Maria Umar</a> founder of the Woman&#8217;s Digital League which brings us to lesson number two:</p><p><strong>Don&#8217;t ever speak Miss Maria&#8217;s name in front of a whole panel of judges, she is just too awesome and does not have time to give your game a try.</strong></p><p>Moving along we had to wait for like 10 mins for the results to get compiled and as predicted we did not get the incubation. Surprisingly four out of the five finalists made it except for us, in other words we were the only ones who were not in the winner&#8217;s photograph with the judges (<strong>sigh</strong>). At first it stung a little, coming so close to winning and being the only one&#8217;s going back empty handed but after a few minutes the moment passed away and I could see the big picture:</p><p><img src="/images/from-plan9/19c2.ali.jpeg" class=left alt="">No, stahp! Thats not the big picture(me) I was talking about(but I do look awesome in it don&#8217;t I?). What I meant was living and working in a place like Peshawar where hardly anyone ever believes you are doing some real work unless you are a doctor or an engineer, Plan9 broadened our vision. Our idea could not take flight here but we did not go back empty handed. We took with ourselves a great deal of motivation, encouragement and most importantly the pathway we need to follow. Our idea was a game like farmville but we learnt that we need to first launch a game like tic-tac-toe and pass through all the process to be ready to take on something as big as this. So here&#8217;s to P@sha, <span class=caps>PITB</span> and all other&#8217;s involved in giving us youngsters a platform like Plan9. We could not launch our balloon here but its ok, we know that there is still hope and we need to sharpen our saw first.
