I got a call from &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DHL&lt;/span&gt; Peshawar at 11-ish today that a package has arrived for me and that I also have to pay its duty. I knew what it was so I ran to pick it up. Lo and behold people my &lt;a href=&quot;http://getpebble.com&quot;&gt;pebble&lt;/a&gt; smart watch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pebble-dhl.JPG&quot; class=&quot;centreThis img-responsive img-rounded&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pebble-box.png&quot; class=&quot;centreThis img-responsive img-rounded&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really excited about it because as &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/hasham2&quot;&gt;Hasham Malik&lt;/a&gt; would say being a hacker and tinkerer, I can develop my own apps for it. Yaayness!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                                <title>Wifi Enable your Raspberry Pi</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Raspberry-Pi-Logo.jpg&quot; class=&quot;centreThis img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it sucks that the Raspberry Pi does not come with a built-in wifi receiver.if you are like me and would like to be free from cables, then follow the instructions and this guide to quickly have your Pi over Wi-fi. You will need the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pipluswifi.JPG&quot; class=&quot;centreThis img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thats a Raspberry by in a very solid &lt;a href=&quot;http://uniquegadgets.com.pk/Raspberry-Pi-Cyntech-Blackberry-Raspberry-Pi-Case-in-Pakistan&quot;&gt;casing&lt;/a&gt; and a TP-Link WN823N Mini Wireless &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; Adapter which works out of the box with Raspberry Pi. The Pi is running Raspbian Wheezy installed on a 16GB SD Card. Now lets get to business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Connect your Pi to you A.P/Router via &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt; Cable&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/poweredON.JPG&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;Photo&quot; data-echo=&quot;/images/poweredON.JPG&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image above pretty much sums it up doesn&amp;#8217;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; into your Pi&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now find out the IP of your Raspberry &lt;acronym title=&quot;Hint: DHCP table on your Router&amp;#39;s configuration page&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;PI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/acronym&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; into it. If done right you will see the following screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/SSHedIN.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Configuring Wifi&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugin the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; Wifi dongle into the Raspberry PI and edit the &lt;strong&gt;wpa_supplicant.conf&lt;/strong&gt; file located at:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must add these lines to the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;={&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ssid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;YOUR_SSID&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;psk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;YOUR_WPA_KEY&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it! Save the file, disconnect the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt; Cable, Restart your PI and enjoy the freedom you just obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you interested, I got the raspberry pi and the casing from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uniquegadgets.com.pk&quot;&gt;Unique Gadgets&lt;/a&gt;. Give them a shoutout so that they continue their amazing service.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                                <title>Meteor Framework</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/meteor.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meteor.com&quot;&gt;meteor&lt;/a&gt; when it was on version 0.0.1. At that moment I knew its going to be a promising framework, call it a hunch or call it a developer&amp;#8217;s perception, I knew what I was looking at is going to be great. It pleases me to see that meteor has grown into a very robust efort with its applications in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.discovermeteor.com/2013/10/15/meteor-enterprise-scoutzie-dashboard/&quot;&gt;Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; as well. You will hear from a lot of people saying that meteor is not ready yet for high developing high end apps. Given below is a list of reasons why I think meteor is going to be the next big thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DDP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I absolutely love the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meteor.com/blog/2012/03/21/introducing-ddp&quot;&gt;distributed data protol&lt;/a&gt; behind meteor. It eliminates the need to query the server side constantly for data by creating a cache on the client side and having the server push data on the wire from a canonical data source. Now note that its only data that is pushed and its upto the client that however way it wants to render it which makes it a lot more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Freedom of Structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are free to structure your code in any way you want, once you deploy or build it all gets concatenated into a single file. No longer developers have to worry about following convention or workflows. In fact they are free to make their own workflow or convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Realtime &amp;amp; Hot Code Pushes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, this is my favourite. Meteor is realtime and websocket enabled out of the box, means that upon new shared data between multiple clients the UI updates automatically. You dont have to write a single line of code to wire it up. Although to configure channels as to make sure no unauthorized data is accessed by the wrong client, you will have to implement your own channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing-a-magick feature that must be mentioned here is the hot code push. Meteor has the ability to store session information and update the complete app while the user is using it as soon as you publish an update. The update is so seamless that it&amp;#8217;s almost crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Smart Packages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meteor comes with a good number of smart packages which make development even faster. Notable of these are the the bootstrap package to quickly create your apps UI with Twitter Bootstrap or the iron-router which allows you to define routes just like you would do in a rails app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community around Meteor reminds me of the earl&amp;quot;y days of Ruby on Rails. People are building amazing things using meteor for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://telesc.pe/&quot;&gt;telescope&lt;/a&gt; which is an open source hacker news clone and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pijs.io/&quot;&gt;PiJS&lt;/a&gt; a cloud based javascrip code deployment tool that can be used to program your Raspberry Pi(Blog post coming soon). These are just two of the many examples you can find on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me meteor is a framework that has revolutionized the way we build web apps. Not only its open source and easy to extend, it has a passionate community that wants to make it as good as any other web framework out there. This is all from me for now, I am still learning meteor and looking forward to create some experimental apps to play with. Expect more from where this post came from dear reader.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                                <title>The Space Explorer in all of us</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/droids-looking-for.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis img-rounded&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We would be lying if any of us said that we have never wondered what lies beyond the cosmos. We would be lying if we were to say that we have looked at the glistening stars in the dark of the night and never wondered if we could ever reach one. My dear readers admit it or not we all share the fascination with deep space. While the age old question &amp;#8220;Are we alone?&amp;#8221; remains unanswered, why is it that whenever we are under the open sky at night we &amp;#8220;do&amp;#8221; look up and wonder about the massive galaxy even if it is for a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is very simple, there is a space explorer in all of us. I have never met a soul who is not interested in learning or sharing knowledge about space. If I had received a little bit of guidance when I was a kid, I would&amp;#8217;ve been a space explorer(or scientist) today at least. I am a huge admirer of NASA&amp;#8217;s work and closely follow the developments in their research and development from day to day. I wish I could for once just visit the International Space Station, it has been a dream too old of mine. Also, not to mention I am a huge Star Wars and Star Trek fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Today I am going to show you guys that you can always find a way to live up to your dream(to some extent). I am a software engineer, I code for a living(and for fun sometimes) and I build solutions to problems. So using this skill of mine I am going to build a ruby script that can interact with &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.nasa.gov/&quot;&gt;Nasa&amp;#8217;s Data &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it will be reusable offcourse. So lets get started.
&lt;p&gt;If you visit the website above and read up the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; documentation you will see that it gives us the following &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;get_recent_datasets&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;get_dataset&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;get_date_datasets&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;get_category_datasets&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;get_tag_datasets&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;get_search_results&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;get_date_index&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;get_category_index&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;get_tag_index&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of them return &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; by default, you can read up on what they do &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.nasa.gov/api-info/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Now lets write our Ruby Wrapper for some of these methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;json&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;mechanize&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;NasaData&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;api_url&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://data.nasa.gov/api/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;recent_datasets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ds_count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Mechanize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;get_recent_datasets?count=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ds_count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get_ds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ds_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Mechanize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;get_dataset?id=&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ds_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

		&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Mechanize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;get_tag_index/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;See, how I used by knowledge of Ruby to write down a quick and easy way to get data about all about space exploration. My point is no matter what your childhood dream has been, you can always find a way to live up to it with your set of skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                                <title>TEDx Peshawar</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tedx1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am attending TEDx Peshawar, and what a splendid opportunity it is to blog about it. The event has been organized by a great team lead by Uzair Khattak who was kind enough to let me be one of the organizers as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/tedx-org.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of people here, even more than I was expecting. The turnout is quite big it appears and it really shows how the youth is interested in sharing and learning ideas. There are some very good speakers here too from different fields and it appears that we are about to learn a lot from their talks. The team has just finished preparing the stage which looks amazing as it is showcasing our culture, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MASH&lt;/span&gt; productions have begun photographing and the projector is finally all set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hosts have now taken the stage and are explaining the idea behind &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TED&lt;/span&gt;. The male host is a funny guy, he is energetic as well and makes jokes to light up the mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first talk is about to begin, a lot of energy and excitement can be felt throughout the hall. &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Salma&lt;/strong&gt; the Director of Pastho Academy is about to take the stage as the first speaker. Dr. Salma has begun her talk by reading from her book about folk songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dr-salma-shaheen.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her words have mesmerized the audience. She quoted the famous Pushto Song &amp;#8220;Lar Sha Pekhawar Ta&amp;#8221; and is explaining how professional the lyrics are. She is explainig how the songs are a complete story in themselves. I have heard these songs numerous times but it never occured to me that how deep the meaning has been. The audience is simply speechless at this moment, the collective feeling is unexplaninable in words. Her talk is over and she left the audience mesmerized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next speaker is Muhammad Akhund who is a historian and writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mr-akhund.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I helped him prepare his slides, he has some great photographs of Peshawar city he wants to showcase. He is explaining the historical importance of Peshawar and its architecture. He adds that how we have destroyed what once used to be a center of cultural treasure. He says that the work that supposed to be done by gold craftsmen was handed out to iron workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next speaker is Mr. Joudat Ayaz who is the secretary of education of KP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/m-joudat.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His talk is titled KP 7.0. He is talking about the initiatives the government is taking for promoting education. He is sharing some statistics about the education department of KP and I am surprised to learn that there are some 27000 teachers in the whole province and some 3.9 million school going children. He is sharing the problems that schools are facing and what the government is planning to do about them. He is sharing the governemnt&amp;#8217;s plan to create a healthier education environment. He is sharing some ideas about how we can improve the conditions. His idea is to have people donate to a school&amp;#8217;s development. He is also talking about a system like Khan Academy that can provide virtual and free education. He says that the governemnt is building a sms based complaint system for under developed areas of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;KPK&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;#8220;We are dreaming to build a better KP and we want all of you to help&amp;#8221; with these motivational words he finished his talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next speaker is Amir Anzur who happens to be a Webpreneur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mr-amir.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the dean of Webpreneur Academy which is a virtual initiative that helps people start business over the Internet. He is stressing the importance of dreams and living them up. He is sharing how can anyone live up to their dreams. Amir says that the first thing is to &amp;#8220;break your dream down into steps and take one step at a time&amp;#8221;.  The second thing is &amp;#8220;little things lead to bigger things&amp;#8221;. The third thing is that &amp;#8220;A six is a nine&amp;#8221; which means that things are not what they may always seem. A truly amazing talk beautifully executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next speaker is Muhammad Asif who I know personally, we have met on numerous occasions and I consider him a mentor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/m-asif.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asif has been a source of inspiration for me from a very long time and right now I can see how he is inspiring others with the story about his entrepreneurial success. He is talking about how he went to US on a scholarship and got the inspiration to start his own company there. That how he came back to Pakistan and struggled as a entrepreneur. He is now a successful entrepreneur and his company&amp;#8217;s tools are used by hundred&amp;#8217;s of brands like Google and Microsoft to name a few. Asif&amp;#8217;s words are very inspiring as he is motivating budding entrepreneurs not to give up and show persistance in their struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next speaker is Dr. Usman who is an expert on health policy and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dr-usman.jpg&quot; class=&quot;centreThis img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usman is talking how he was disappointed about the health system of our country and how he decided to pursue fixing it. He is emphasizing the importance of electronic health records. He is telling how the drug prescriptions are written on paper in Pakistan and how poor the quality is. In his study he found that on most of these prescriptions there is no diagnosis, no drug dose, no idea about the duration of the usage and surprisingly there was no physician reg. no. He is working on an idea about a sms based prescription. Its a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am back from a tea break, had two samosas and a cup of tea like gentlemen do. The event is about to resume did I mention its very hot here? Thankfully the Air Conditioners are working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next speaker is Muneeb Khawaja who is a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/mr-muneeb.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says he is no entrepreneur, he is just passionate about technology and learning. He is showing how to redefine yourselves. He is talking about how people have gained success. &amp;#8220;Internet has made everything global&amp;#8221; he says. He is showing the audience how open education and knowledge have become. He is telling his story about how he gained his clients by creating a web presence for himself. He is giving examples how people have achieved their dream jobs by showing their passion about them on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stage is about to be taken by twin brothers Asad and Jamshaid who are musicians. Everyone is extremely excited to listen to some music after an amazing series of talks. My cell phone&amp;#8217;s battery has run out so I have to improvise and use my macbook&amp;#8217;s camera. Here is a video of their performance(sorry for the bad quality):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/75101872 &quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this amazing performance the audience members are being invited to share their ideas. This is called the pitch session. I am surprised to see college students on the stage, such confidencne and clarity in presenting their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the event has come to an end. My buddy Usman joined me at the end as I was an organizer. I have received a delicious cupcake as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/cupcake-me.png&quot; class=&quot;centreThis img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all folks looking forward to the next &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;TED&lt;/span&gt; event in Peshawar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                                <title>The big blog revamp</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been slowly working the past few months completely revamping my blog. Although I liked the grid based design the blog had previously which looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/aliirzoldDesign.png&quot; class=&quot;centreThis img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt as if that my blog wasn&amp;#8217;t focusing enough on what was important i.e. content. So I decided to look into a new design and one thing lead to another, the result is in front of you. I would like to highlight whats new and the things I have learnt on this long journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Under The Hood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me begin with what is it that is making the whole blog tick. Its nothing, except &lt;strong&gt;HTML5&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;CSS3&lt;/strong&gt;. The glue that is holding it all together is the popular static site generator &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; but instead of using jekyll simply, I am using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://yeoman.io&quot;&gt;yeoman&lt;/a&gt; generator to have a more &lt;a href=&quot;:https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb&quot;&gt;streamlined workflow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/yeoman.png&quot; class=&quot;centreThis img-responsive&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog is now powered by numerous node modules that &lt;a href=&quot;http://gruntjs.com&quot;&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt; runs in order to minify, concat and deploy my blog&amp;#8217;s content. I am using &lt;a href=&quot;http://bower.io&quot;&gt;bower&lt;/a&gt; for package managment making sure that all packages I am using are up to date and stable versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Logo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog now fashions its own logo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/logo.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logo represents the intellectual nature of a geek&amp;#8217;s head. Wired up on technology, using science and creativity to answer the world&amp;#8217;s problems. The inspiration came from the theory of &lt;a href=&quot;http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/a/left-brain-right-brain.htm&quot;&gt;left and right brains&lt;/a&gt; which states that we use the left side to solve and think over maths or science while the right side is more creative and that is where art or design comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface has been completely re-designed with &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Bootstrap v3.0&lt;/a&gt; . If you recall my earlier design used &lt;a href=&quot;http://foundation.zurb.com&quot;&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt; which itself is a great &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; framework but working with bootstrap from a very long time now I feel accustomed to it&amp;#8217;s grid and other features so deciding on Bootstrap as the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; framework to use was a no brainer at all. I also added some UI goodness via CSS3 transitions and animations. Oh and its responsive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/aliirz-responsive.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Minimalism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog is now focusing more on minimalism which has become my mantra towards achieving goals these days and I am planning to live life by that as well. I find solace and peace in simplicity and same goes for minimal user experiences. One aspect I really enjoy of minimalistc design is the typography, that is why I have chosen to give more focus to typefaces in the new design rather than images or other UI goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do give me some feedback if you read this, if there is anything you would like to know about this design iteration or see anything that can be improved, please share it in the comments below. As always all my code is availbale on &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/aliirz&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; for the world to fork and play with. If you do use anything from my code please remember to pay it forward and I would appreciate if you link back here(not mandatory btw).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                                <title>Just Keep Swimming</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Benefits-of-Swimming.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis img-rounded&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll admit, my mind no longer works the same way as it used to work 4 years ago. I have now a lot to do, lot to think and lot to plan. Things have not been easy but every step has shaped me into someone I would not want to mess with if I had met him 5 years ago. My problem has always been putting others in front of me, thankfully now that i have recognized it I no longer fear outcomes, I feel like a doer. The mantra I follow is to &amp;#8220;just keep swimming&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life has the habit of beating you down, the more you expect the more you get hurt. So instead of expecting things just &amp;#8220;do&amp;#8221; and move on. If its supposed to work its gonna happen otherwise it was worth a try. All I am trying to say is that don&amp;#8217;t let anything stop you from doing what you have always wanted to do. There can be hurdles but you can always cross them. Your life might become difficult for some time, but the rest of it will be spent in the joy of knowing you lived it the way you always wanted to. Rock On!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                                <title>GBG Peshawar</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;So I attended an event organized by &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;GBG&lt;/span&gt; Islamabad and The Digital League. It was the first ever event to be organized for women enterpreneurs here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MariaUmar&quot;&gt;Maria Umar&lt;/a&gt; and Premier Formica Industries. The event got kicked off by a presentation on Google Adwords by Saad Hameed. He explained using Adwords to your advantage for higher rate of conversions. Saad also gave examples of creating good Ads and how to specifically target your Ads towards select users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second session was about How to stay safe online. The presentation was given by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UsamaKhilji&quot;&gt;Usama Khilji&lt;/a&gt; who explained it all pretty well to changes passwords periodocially&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know this all sounds boring. Ha! I got you all didn&amp;#8217;t I? I was trying to doze you all to sleep. Well actually the event was pretty nice. It was really cool to see some enterepreneurs from KP show up. I met Haris N. another celebrity in the Pakistani tech. scene the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.androidpakistan.com&quot;&gt;Android Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; . It was a wonderful experience meeting all these amazing people many of whom are the next generation of enterpreneurs. Now I feel much more confident following the path I have chosen(More on that in another post). The tech. industry of Pakistan is setting its eyes upon KP and it means good things are about to happen. &lt;strong&gt;Fingers Crossed!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                                <title>Helios</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/helios-img.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive centreThis&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have been working on one of the client apps enabling it to support push notifications. The huge question was what should I use as a suitable backend to serve as my &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;APN&lt;/span&gt; Provider? After a lot of digging I settled for apn_on_rails a great gem, has been around from a long time and it seems a lot of people are using it. However, after stumbling upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://helios.io&quot;&gt;Helios&lt;/a&gt; I completely changed my mind. Helios is a wonderful little framework written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mattt&quot;&gt;Matt Thompson&lt;/a&gt; which provides out of the box push notification, passbook, in-app purchase and remote data synchronization. This means that the developer&amp;#8217;s job got a whole lot less as most of the heavy-lifting backend technology is already crafted into this wonderful little solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would totally advise to anyone struggling with Backends for their iOS Apps to give Helios a try. It can very easily be integrated with a Rack/Sinatra or Rails app. The few things to keep in mind is to install the edge version of the gem. A very special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gregplumbly&quot;&gt;Greg&lt;/a&gt; for pointing this out. I struggled a lot with this issue at first. The push message feature of the current gem is broken so in your Gemfile specify the Helios gem like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;helios&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;https://github.com/helios-framework/helios.git&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To send push messages you currently have to do a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; to /message of whatever your url is. I am pretty sure a built in compose section is on its way too(why not submit a pull request?). Anyways if you encounter any problems do checkout the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/helios-framework/helios&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; , go through the ReadMe its very easy to setup and use. Helios is created from many other opensource components like RackPushNotfication and Houston. It not only solves the issue of device registration and maintanenace via the Orbiter library but also provides backend to have your Apps Data(Core Data Models) Synchronize remotely. I think we iOS+Ruby Devs should focus more on collabarating on this project and make it a stable solution rather than creating our own &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;APN&lt;/span&gt; Providers as it seems very promising and focuses on the issues we all suffer the most. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                                <title>Getting Started with Backbone js</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/backbone-logo.PNG&quot; class=&quot;centreThis img-responsive img-rounded&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;When I first heard the term client-side &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; I got a vague picture of some sharply written framework in javascript whose job will be to improve the user experience. Being a dev who has been working with &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; frameworks from quite some time(Rails, Cocoa and Asp) I failed to imagine and apply the advantages of &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; based approach on the client side. It was not until one fine summer afternoon when I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.backbonejs.org&quot;&gt;Backbone.js&lt;/a&gt; on Github, I was finally able to comprehend the level of awesomeness client side &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; offered. I was working on a project called &lt;a href=&quot;http://kronos.appointmentor.com&quot;&gt;Kronos&lt;/a&gt; which relied heavily on javascript and needless to say all the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;DOM&lt;/span&gt; code for jQuery quickly became spaghetti and difficult to maintain. That&amp;#8217;s when I finally realized the main objective of client side &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; or MV* frameworks, to keep your code maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now allow me to elaborate this a little from my experience. If you are the kind of developer who just writes a few lines of javascript code(possible jQuery) to animate a box or fetch a json Feed, an MV* framework is not for you. If you are however a javascript ninja and have to write hundreds of lines of code, to perform &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;CRUD&lt;/span&gt;, provide a neat UX and/or keep your code readable, go with a MV* framework like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.backbonejs.org&quot;&gt;Backbone.js&lt;/a&gt; and be a happy camper for the rest of your dev life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backbone.js like ever other MV* or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; framework is based on the simple principle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seperation of Concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Backbone.js&amp;#8217; case the main components are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, models here are the data and all the operations like validations, computations etc. we apply on them. In backbone.js a model is defined like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;    
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Backbone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to this world&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;person&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Views&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now notice that I have been calling backbone.js a MV* framework rather than a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVVM&lt;/span&gt; framework, thats because there are no controllers or ViewModels here. Your controller logic if any, lives inside a View in backbone.js so you view is bascially a ViewController.Views are how the data is presented in your app. You are allowed to take advantage of javascript templating libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;http://emberjs.com/&quot;&gt;Ember.js&lt;/a&gt; . This is how a view is defined in backbone.js:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SearchView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Backbone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Alerts suck.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// The initialize function is always called when instantiating a Backbone View.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Consider it the constructor of the class.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;search_view&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SearchView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Routers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last piece of the puzzle. The Router&amp;#8217;s job is to understand and provide the urls necessary for your client side code to work in conjuction with the server side. Althought not necessary to implement, but if your app uses url routing etc they make the job easier. This is how on defines a router:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppRouter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Backbone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;extend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;routes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;*actions&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;defaultRoute&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// matches http://example.com/#anything-here&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Initiate the router&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app_router&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AppRouter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app_router&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;route:defaultRoute&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;actions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;actions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Start Backbone history a necessary step for bookmarkable URL&amp;#39;s&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Backbone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;history&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some resources I found useful in getting started with backbone.js:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope those of you who are starting with client side &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt;/MV* or are already working on it find this post useful. This is all for now. Rock on!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
