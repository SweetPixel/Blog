I have now a lot to do, lot to think and lot to plan. Things have not been easy but every step has shaped me into someone I would not want to mess with if I had met him 5 years ago. My problem has always been putting others in front of me, thankfully now that i have recognized it I no longer fear outcomes, I feel like a doer.

The event got kicked off by a presentation on Google Adwords by Saad Hameed. He explained using Adwords to your advantage for higher rate of conversions. Saad also gave examples of creating good Ads and how to specifically target your Ads towards select users.</p><p>The second session was about How to stay safe online.

Ha! I got you all didn&#8217;t I? I was trying to doze you all to sleep. Well actually the event was pretty nice. It was really cool to see some enterepreneurs from KP show up. I met Haris N. another celebrity in the Pakistani tech. scene the founder of <a href="http://www.androidpakistan.com">Android Pakistan</a> . It was a wonderful experience meeting all these amazing people many of whom are the next generation of enterpreneurs. Now I feel much more confident following the path I have chosen(More on that in another post). The tech. industry of Pakistan is setting its eyes upon KP and it means good things are about to happen. <strong>Fingers Crossed!</strong></p>Google Business Group comes to KPK.<br><a class=button-link href="/events/2013/07/06/GBG-Peshawar/">Read it</a><p class=tags>Posted under <a href="/categories/events/">events</a></p></article></li><li><article class=blog-post><div class=published>05 May 2013</div><h1><a href="/rails/2013/05/05/Helios/">Helios</a></h1><p></p><p>I have been working on one of the client apps enabling it to support push notifications. The huge question was what should I use as a suitable backend to serve as my <span class=caps>APN</span> Provider? After a lot of digging I settled for apn_on_rails a great gem, has been around from a long time and it seems a lot of people are using it. However, after stumbling upon <a href="http://helios.io">Helios</a> I completely changed my mind. Helios is a wonderful little framework written by <a href="https://github.com/mattt">Matt Thompson</a> which provides out of the box push notification, passbook, in-app purchase and remote data synchronization. This means that the developer&#8217;s job got a whole lot less as most of the heavy-lifting backend technology is already crafted into this wonderful little solution.</p><p>I would totally advise to anyone struggling with Backends for their iOS Apps to give Helios a try. It can very easily be integrated with a Rack/Sinatra or Rails app. The few things to keep in mind is to install the edge version of the gem. A very special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/gregplumbly">Greg</a> for pointing this out. I struggled a lot with this issue at first. The push message feature of the current gem is broken so in your Gemfile specify the Helios gem like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=ruby><span class=n>gem</span> <span class=s2>&quot;helios&quot;</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=ss>:git</span> <span class=o>=&gt;</span> <span class=s2>&quot;https://github.com/helios-framework/helios.git&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To send push messages you currently have to do a <span class=caps>HTTP</span> <span class=caps>POST</span> to /message of whatever your url is. I am pretty sure a built in compose section is on its way too(why not submit a pull request?). Anyways if you encounter any problems do checkout the <a href="https://github.com/helios-framework/helios">source</a> , go through the ReadMe its very easy to setup and use. Helios is created from many other opensource components like RackPushNotfication and Houston. It not only solves the issue of device registration and maintanenace via the Orbiter library but also provides backend to have your Apps Data(Core Data Models) Synchronize remotely. I think we iOS+Ruby Devs should focus more on collabarating on this project and make it a stable solution rather than creating our own <span class=caps>APN</span> Providers as it seems very promising and focuses on the issues we all suffer the most. Cheers.</p>For all your app backend needs(almost).<br><a class=button-link href="/rails/2013/05/05/Helios/">Read it</a><p class=tags>Posted under <a href="/categories/rails/">rails</a></p></article></li><li><article class=blog-post><div class=published>24 Oct 2012</div><h1><a href="/javascript/2012/10/24/Getting-Started-Backbonejs/">Getting Started with Backbone js</a></h1><p></p><p><img src="/images/backbone-logo.PNG" class="centreThis img-responsive img-rounded" alt="">When I first heard the term client-side <span class=caps>MVC</span> I got a vague picture of some sharply written framework in javascript whose job will be to improve the user experience. Being a dev who has been working with <span class=caps>MVC</span> frameworks from quite some time(Rails, Cocoa and Asp) I failed to imagine and apply the advantages of <span class=caps>MVC</span> based approach on the client side. It was not until one fine summer afternoon when I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a> on Github, I was finally able to comprehend the level of awesomeness client side <span class=caps>MVC</span> offered. I was working on a project called <a href="http://kronos.appointmentor.com">Kronos</a> which relied heavily on javascript and needless to say all the <span class=caps>DOM</span> code for jQuery quickly became spaghetti and difficult to maintain. That&#8217;s when I finally realized the main objective of client side <span class=caps>MVC</span> or MV* frameworks, to keep your code maintainable.</p><p>Now allow me to elaborate this a little from my experience. If you are the kind of developer who just writes a few lines of javascript code(possible jQuery) to animate a box or fetch a json Feed, an MV* framework is not for you. If you are however a javascript ninja and have to write hundreds of lines of code, to perform <span class=caps>CRUD</span>, provide a neat UX and/or keep your code readable, go with a MV* framework like <a href="http://www.backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a> and be a happy camper for the rest of your dev life.</p><p><a class=button-link href="/javascript/2012/10/24/Getting-Started-Backbonejs/">Read More...</a></p><p class=tags>Posted under <a href="/categories/javascript/">javascript</a></p></article></li></ul><div class=blog-pagination><div class=newer></div><div class=older><a href="/page2/">Older posts »</a></div></div></div><aside class=col-md-3><h2>Ali Raza</h2><img src="/images/cda2.ali.jpg" class="img-circle img-responsive"><p>Tech.
