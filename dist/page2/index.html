As most of you know Plan9 is a platform for young entrepreneurs(like moi) to present and get help turn their ideas into a reality. Its a pretty sweet deal once your get shortlisted; they give you an office at Arfa Software Technology Park, Mentorship, Rs. 20K monthly stripend to each member of your team and six months to complete the project. Seriously its worth it, too bad you are gonna wait till the next time its announced as all deadlines have ended. More information on their <a href="http://plan9.pitb.gov.pk/">website.</a></p><p>I received an email on Friday after prayers that we had been selected to attend Plan9 Islamabad to pitch our idea so on a very short notice me and my buddies arranged accomodation/travel as the event was to take place tomorrow i.e. Saturday. Once we reached our Hotel we had dinner and prepared our pitch. We brought our best idea and we knew it was too good to say no to. It was a game we had been working on from quite some time now(more on that later) but again this post is not about the idea its about the experience. So where was I? Oh yes we had a good night sleep and went to Comsats islamabad the next day for initial pitches. The event started a bit late(the story of Pakistan, the participants showed up late). Anyhow the first batch of pitches started, we were told that some 200 people had applied and only 30 made it here. That boosted our confidence to a ninja level. Then came the time to present the idea in front of the judges. Yeah the judges, what we did not know that the pioneer of the gaming industry in Pakistan Mr. <a href="http://twitter.com/sheryhydri">Shehryar Hydri</a> will be presiding there. We were already starting to lose some sweat but as soon as we gave our first pitch I had a hunch that guys no matter what happens we are clearing the first shortlisting round today, my partner&#8217;s however had mixed opinions. Anyways we did get shortlisted among four others from the total of thirty applicants(I was right). Then started the mentoring session which was the real eye-opener for me. We spent some good two hours talking to different mentors who were there for us and we refined our idea with the help of Shery Bhai, Mr. Syed and other mentors. What we really enjoyed was the mentoring session by Shery Bhai who like an elder experienced brother made us realize that we brought the wrong idea to the table here. We quickly realized that we might not make it any further which made us learn the first lesson:</p><p><strong>Don&#8217;t bring an AK47 to a Knife fight.</strong></p><p><img src="/images/from-plan9/bf1d.mateen-usman.jpeg" class=right alt="">So this was the end of the first day, at the end of which I suffered from the worst headache ever, took two pills of aspirin and it was good night Pakistan for me. Then comes in the final pitch day a.k.a the reckoning. We woke up pretty early and started working on the presentation in the hotel. Once done we made our way to the university and got some final mentoring from Shery Bhai. Deep in our hearts we knew this was the end of it, we are not going to make it any further and probably never end up sitting in Arfa Software Technology park but we went along with it anyway. We gave our final pitch, tried the best we could. At one point we were asked could we name one female who takes care of her home and will play the game we are building and all of a sudden the first woman who came in my mind was The awesome <a href="http://pakimom.wordpress.com">Miss Maria Umar</a> founder of the Woman&#8217;s Digital League which brings us to lesson number two:</p><p><strong>Don&#8217;t ever speak Miss Maria&#8217;s name in front of a whole panel of judges, she is just too awesome and does not have time to give your game a try.</strong></p><p>Moving along we had to wait for like 10 mins for the results to get compiled and as predicted we did not get the incubation. Surprisingly four out of the five finalists made it except for us, in other words we were the only ones who were not in the winner&#8217;s photograph with the judges (<strong>sigh</strong>). At first it stung a little, coming so close to winning and being the only one&#8217;s going back empty handed but after a few minutes the moment passed away and I could see the big picture:</p><p><img src="/images/from-plan9/19c2.ali.jpeg" class=left alt="">No, stahp! Thats not the big picture(me) I was talking about(but I do look awesome in it don&#8217;t I?). What I meant was living and working in a place like Peshawar where hardly anyone ever believes you are doing some real work unless you are a doctor or an engineer, Plan9 broadened our vision. Our idea could not take flight here but we did not go back empty handed. We took with ourselves a great deal of motivation, encouragement and most importantly the pathway we need to follow. Our idea was a game like farmville but we learnt that we need to first launch a game like tic-tac-toe and pass through all the process to be ready to take on something as big as this. So here&#8217;s to P@sha, <span class=caps>PITB</span> and all other&#8217;s involved in giving us youngsters a platform like Plan9. We could not launch our balloon here but its ok, we know that there is still hope and we need to sharpen our saw first. Thank you :)</p>Our experience at Plan9 Where Ideas/Balloons take flight.<br><a class=button-link href="/events/2012/10/12/Plan9-Islamabad/">Read it</a><p class=tags>Posted under <a href="/categories/events/">events</a></p></article></li><li><article class=blog-post><div class=published>24 Aug 2012</div><h1><a href="/thoughts/2012/08/24/Its-ok-to-fail/">Epic Fails are OK</a></h1><p></p><p><img src="/images/c9a4.picard-facepalm.jpg" class=right alt="">I have observed that people are most afraid of failure or having to relive their life&#8217;s most embarrassing moments again. This is not a motivational post to tell you its all going to be fine, in fact this is a list of epic fails from my own life to tell you that it&#8217;s ok to fail. Its all a part of your life and the most valuable lessons you learn are from failures/embarrassing moments. So here&#8217;s my list of Epic Fails, enjoy:</p><h3>Got Punched by a girl</h3><p><strong>Failometer Level:</strong> 3/10</p><p>This is the oldest epic fail I can remember. There was this girl, I dont remember her name, she was a bully(I did not know it either). She was playing with sand(used to be a hit back then). So me being a curious person I am, asked her nicely what was she building only to be punched in the face(she had a wicked arm I tell you). I completely blacked out, cried in a corner, was too afraid to tell the teacher and had a swollen lip. Girl! I hope wherever you are, Karma got the best of you and your marriage is in shambles and you quitely cry yourself to sleep thinking about the little boy you punched. Screw You!</p><p><em>Lesson Learnt:</em> If somebody is mean to you, kick their ass</p><h3>Was a Carrot</h3><p><strong>Failometer Level:</strong> Carrot/10</p><p><img src="/images/fb65.220px-CarrotRoots.jpg" class=left alt="">This is another one from school. I was among the really tall kids in my class and there was moment when I was the tallest. Annual day was coming and teacher tells us we are going to be playing vegetables. Everybody is super excited offcourse, except me. Why? The teacher tells me, as I am very tall I get to be a carrot. I could see it coming but went along with it anyway. So I played the role of a carrot, and had to live by the nickname of Gajar(Carrot in Urdu) for like a very long time. I have the video of it somewhere on <span class=caps>VHS</span>, if anybody has the equipment to convert it to digital format please let me know so that I may once again live the embarrassment.</p><p><em>Lesson Learnt:</em> Dont be a Carrot</p><h3>Got Stitches for trying to act Cool</h3><p><strong>Failometer Level:</strong> 6.5/10</p><p>Another one from my school days(Yeah I know). This one was made to look like an accident for the sake of two things:</p><ol><li>Not to get busted for breaking a glass pane in the door.</li><li>Not to look like an idiot who just tried to pull off a stunt to look cool and got a bloody arm as a result.</li></ol><p><img src="/images/6474.stitches.jpg" class=right alt="">The story is that I was performing whudu(abulation) in the wash room and all of a sudden this troll friend of mine appears and locks the door behind me. Now I act cool(panic mode: on) and decide to break one the glass panes in the door to open the lock. With all my force I punched the glass pane, hear the triumphant sound of it shattering and open the door. As soon as I come out, I get a feeling something is not right. I look at my hand to find it bleeding like &#8220;<span class=caps>OMG</span>!!! Its time to panic, quick scream like a little girl and embarrass yourself&#8221;. I made up a story that I slipped when somebody was opening the door from the other side and my hand went throught the glass pane. Why am I telling the truth now? because screw the school, it does not even exist anymore(They sold it off to make a buck load of money). I got five stitches(the bad part) and a couple of days off(the good part).</p><p><em>Lesson Learnt:</em> Dont Panic</p><h3>New Shirt, Forgot to take Price Tag <span class=caps>OFF</span></h3><p><strong>Failometer Level:</strong> 2/10</p><p>This one is from the glorious days of university. I was the newly appointed President of the Computer Cell(a Team of Awesome People like me who loved to code and had a problem with almost everything) and as my first order or business I called a meeting to throw away ideas. Throughout the meeting my fellow people kept on smiling and giggling while elbowing each other. I knew something was wrong, at first I thought my fly was open(Thank God it was not). After the meeting I was told by a friend that I have a price tag on my shirt, which shows it was recently bought. I could not think of anything to say at that moment and spent the rest of the day staring blankly out of the cafeteria window.</p><p><em>Lesson Learnt:</em> Pay attention to your wardrobe</p><h3>Made the jump of the century, sprained my ankle</h3><p><strong>Failometer Level:</strong> 7/10</p><p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Ankle_en.svg/230px-Ankle_en.svg.png" class=right alt="">This epic fail happened when I was gone for my <span class=caps>ISSB</span> Examination. For those of you who do not know, its an exam you have to appear for in order to get selected in the Armed Forces of Pakistan. Its an intensive test of physical and mental endurannce in which they interview you, ask embarrassing questions, make you run through an obstacle course and force you to go to sleep before 11 pm. No, I did not die and Yes I did not get selected, instead I earned the worst ever sprain my ankle has ever felt. I had to jump off a platform, climb on another that was 5 feet high and finally jump on the ground to land safely on some sand. I make the most awesome jump ever(<strong>insert dramatic music</strong>) and instead of landing on the sand I landed feet first on solid ground. As a result I got a sprained ankle and had difficulty walking for weeks.</p><p><em>Lesson Learnt:</em> Look before you leap.</p><h3>Forgot the lyrics of a song I was singing</h3><p><strong>Failometer Level:</strong> Don&#8217;t Ask/10</p><p>This is the most epic fail ever and I have video proof of it. I was taking part in a competition at my university and had to sing a song. So I chose a song I really like and went along singning it. It was going very well(as you can observe by the applause) when my scumbag brain decided to forget the lyrics in between and make me choke. Thankfully the audience helped me remember and I continued to sing but I am never going to forget this epic fail, ever! Here is the video:</p><p><iframe src="http://www.twitvid.com/embed.php?guid=AZA7S&autoplay=0" title="Twitvid video player " class=twitvid-player type="text/html" width=480 height=360 frameborder=0></iframe></p><h2>Final Words</h2><p>Your epic fails are awesome(so are you!) and when you recall them you realize what a fun life you&#8217;ve had. I am not ashamed of these moments(Duh! I just wrote about them) for they have shaped me into a better and stronger person. So don&#8217;t be embarrassed to remember and laugh out loud on your epic fails Feel free to share them in the comments if you would like. Hope you enjoyed this post my dear readers.</p>Some of my life's most epic fails.<br><a class=button-link href="/thoughts/2012/08/24/Its-ok-to-fail/">Read it</a><p class=tags>Posted under <a href="/categories/thoughts/">thoughts</a></p></article></li><li><article class=blog-post><div class=published>12 Aug 2012</div><h1><a href="/rails/2012/08/12/Couponific/">Couponific</a></h1><p></p><p>I have been working with MVC3 for over two months now and I needed a distraction.

I did not want to get the data from the database, I wanted a simpler approach so I decided to use an <span class=caps>XML</span> file to populate my dropdown list. Here&#8217;s how I did it:</p><p>First I created an <span class=caps>XML</span> file:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=xml><span class=cp>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;</span>
<span class=nt>&lt;Countries&gt;</span>
  <span class=nt>&lt;Country</span> <span class=na>name=</span><span class=s>&quot;Pakistan&quot;</span> <span class=na>value=</span><span class=s>&quot;PK&quot;</span><span class=nt>&gt;&lt;/Country&gt;</span>
  <span class=nt>&lt;Country</span> <span class=na>name=</span><span class=s>&quot;America&quot;</span> <span class=na>value=</span><span class=s>&quot;USA&quot;</span><span class=nt>&gt;&lt;/Country&gt;</span>
  <span class=nt>&lt;Country</span> <span class=na>name=</span><span class=s>&quot;England&quot;</span> <span class=na>value=</span><span class=s>&quot;UK&quot;</span><span class=nt>&gt;&lt;/Country&gt;</span>
<span class=nt>&lt;/Countries&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then after doing a barrell roll, I proceeded to write some code inside my controller to take the data from this <span class=caps>XML</span> file and put it inside the magical ViewBag:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=csharp><span class=kt>string</span> <span class=n>path</span> <span class=p>=</span> <span class=s>&quot;~/Countries.xml&quot;</span><span class=p>;</span>

The last piece of the puzzle is offcourse the razor view where I show this data from the <span class=caps>XML</span> file inside a dd, here is how that is implemented:</p><i>@Html.DropDownListFor(model =&gt; model.Country, (IEnumerable<selectlistitem>)ViewBag.countries)</selectlistitem></i><br><br><p>Thats it, a super simple quick hack to populate your dropdowns.

That was a time I just blogged whatever went through my head. This blog post is kind sorta typa(I know one of the readers who will say &#8220;There is no such word as typa&#8221;) like that. I see we live in strange times where humor is found in Internet Memes or TV Shows which have laugh tracks to tell us when to explode into laughter. Today you may have a thousand friends on Facebook but none in real life, today you know where your friends check-in to eat, but you forget where they used to live. Today its easy to hold a grudge and extremely difficult to forgive(I prefer the later though).</p><p>I have seen things and people change in front of my eyes, for better and for worse. The ones you mostly expect to have your back are usually the ones who stab you first and vice versa. But thats not my point. Imagine you fall upon a time machine that allows you to go back in time to the one cherished memory you have that seems to give you hope all the time. Some would prefer to use it to take revenge, while some like me would prefer to spend a few moments with our parents back in time. Now thats the problem! We dont see life as a journey we think of it as a phase, a collection of memories and a never-ending fear of uncertainity. Wake up people life is just a journey, things and people are suppose to change, move on and if possible dont ever change(for worse) beacause its you who will make a difference in the end for yourself. Rock on!</p>A totally non-geek blog post from the geek's head.<br><a class=button-link href="/thoughts/2012/07/06/The-Journey-that-is-life/">Read it</a><p class=tags>Posted under <a href="/categories/thoughts/">thoughts</a></p></article></li><li><article class=blog-post><div class=published>17 May 2012</div><h1><a href="/.net/2012/05/17/Whats-new-in-MVC4/">Whats new in MVC4</a></h1><p></p><p>It&#8217;s been a couple of days that I am playing with MVC4 in my free time. I installed Visual Studio 11 Beta for the Web as soon as it came out, but never really got the chance to check it out properly. We had a power outage today for like 7 hours which and I had no Internets(yes I like to call it Internets, its not a Typo) which gave me time to check out MVC4 and I have one word for it, Cheese Omellete. Ok thats two words but thats how MVC4 made me feel, a healthy and delicious breakfast recipe. So here is a little breakdown of the new features of MVC4:</p><h3><span class=caps>ASP</span>.<span class=caps>NET</span> Web <span class=caps>API</span></h3><p>Sounds cool doesn&#8217;t it. A framework that can create <span class=caps>HTTP</span> Services that work on any client, be it mobile or web browser. It also makes it dead simple to write <span class=caps>REST</span> Service. Do give this one a try, you will be making web services better than you grandpa ever could. Some of it&#8217;s features are:</p><ul><li>Modern <span class=caps>HTTP</span> Programming Model.</li><li>Full Support for Routes(Yes works pretty much like Rails now).</li><li>Content Negotiation(This is smart, the client and server are now able to determine the data type being returned. You can also add your own formats.)</li><li>Self Host(You can host a Web <span class=caps>API</span> inside your own process or <span class=caps>IIS</span> and can still use routes etc.)</li></ul><p>Click <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">here</a> for more information on the <span class=caps>ASP</span>.<span class=caps>NET</span> Web <span class=caps>API</span></p><h3>Single Page Applications</h3><p>This one is my favourite. You can now create a Single Page Application with rich client functionality using the built-in scaffoldings. You single page application will have a very small footprint yet having all you need. Need a <span class=caps>DAL</span>? No Problemo! Thats supported too. Click <a href="http://www.asp.net/single-page-application">here</a> for more information on single page applications.</p><h3>Enhanced Default Project Templates</h3><p>Looks like MS finally understands that nobody likes the default project template that comes with MVC3 and Web Forms. So they have shashkafied the default project template(See images below). It not only looks better, it&#8217;s responsive too. Yes! Out of the box Responsiveness. Progressive Enhancement Extraordinare MS! Bravo!</p><p><img src="http://i1.asp.net/common/www-css/i/mvc4/image001.png" alt=""><br><img src="http://i1.asp.net/common/www-css/i/mvc4/image002.png" alt=""><br><img src="http://i1.asp.net/common/www-css/i/mvc4/image003.png" alt=""></p><h3>Mobile Project Template</h3><p>You can now create web apps for mobile using builtin templates too. The Views are based on jQuery Mobile while all the other code(Controllers) is exactly the same as the normal Template. To me this is a much needed feature. I am not a very good designer and often the need arises to create a Mobile Optimized one or two page App to use in my iOS Apps&#8217; Web Views. This makes things fast for me.</p><p><img src="http://i1.asp.net/common/www-css/i/mvc4/image004.png" alt=""></p><h3>Final Words</h3><p>My experience with MVC4 is going great. I am developging an OAuth based Web App just to master it and I will share my experience once I am done. All I can say for now is that MVC4 makes me feel like a happy developer. There are a lot of other neat features like Recipe&#8217;s which allow you to generate template based code(Custom or 3rd Party), Browser Overriding, View Switching etc. etc. IF you want to read up a full list of features then please check out the <a href="www.asp.net/whitepapers/mvc4-release-notes">Release Notes</a> .
