I registered this domain name while I was using wordpress by using the wordpress upgrades and paid $10 for it. After switching to jekyll I pointed the aliirz.com to name servers at Linode. Two days ago I got an email from Wordpress Customer services that my domain registration is about to expire and I need renew it. As soon as I saw the email I signed into my wordpress dashboard to make the payment. To my surprise I got the following error message when I tried to make the payment:</p><div class="alert-box error"><p>This credit card was issued from an unsupported country.</p></div><p>Now this make me a little angry and disappointed. So I emailed back the customer service:</p><blockquote><p>Hello</p><p>I am trying to upgrade my domain manually and I am getting the following<br>error:</p><p>This credit card was issued from an unsupported country.</p><p>This is quite disappointing as I used the same card to purchase and map<br>my domain on WordPress an year ago. Can you please help?</p><p>Regards</p></blockquote><p>I was expecting a reply that would say something like &#8220;I am sorry we no longer accept credit cards from your country as per our new policy. Happy Wordpressing&#8221;. If it had been this kind a reply I would&#8217;ve gone all nuclear on wordpress but to my surprise instead this is that they replied back with today:</p><blockquote><p>Hi Ali,</p><p>Sorry for the delay in getting back to you!</p><p>This is known issue, our credit card processor recently changed the counties that they accept cards from. We are currently investigation alternatives, but in the mean time I have added a full year to the domain registration and domain mapping for you.</p><p>If there is anything else I can help with just let me know.</p><p>Ray<br>WordPress.com | Automattic</p></blockquote><p>Folks! Thats the kind of customer service that makes you smile.

Hassan and his brother Momin Raza share and play with these hotwheels for hours but today they asked me a very creative thing. They&#8217;ve always wanted to show their collection to their friends but have never really got the chance so they asked me to make a photo gallery of their hotwheels, so here it is to you too my nephews.

Yes, today is my 25th Birthday. I have been looking back at the time and my achievements. I have been thinking, Am I really happy with all this? The answer is a bit confusing but I can see that today I have come to the point where I am forced to think over all my priorities and what I want to do. I want to do something big, I want to do something that makes me happy. Its time I start re-thinking life and start doing what I want rather than letting events or people drive me.</p><p>I cannot share anymore thoughts on this at the moment but All I know for now is that I just want to be happy :)</p>My thoughts on my birthday<br><a class=button-link href="/thoughts/2012/04/18/twenty-fifth-birthday/">Read it</a><p class=tags>Posted under <a href="/categories/thoughts/">thoughts</a></p></article></li><li><article class=blog-post><div class=published>09 Apr 2012</div><h1><a href="/thoughts/2012/04/09/Windows-Phone-thoughts/">To Windows Phone or Not</a></h1><p></p><p>Many of you do not know that my first smartphone was a Windows Mobile 6.5 based <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/i_mate_jasjam-1589.php">i-Mate JasJam</a> . I loved that phone it was all one geek could ask for at that time, it had <span class=caps>GPS</span>, Google Maps, a powerful browser, a Qwerty keyboard and a stylus(trust me stylus&#8217; were cool back then) I got this phone as a gift from my brother. Boy, Was I happy with it. After an year of usage the whole shashka(awesomeness) of the phone started to die, possibly because Microsoft stopped focusing on their Mobile OS side. So I sold the phone to a friend and bought an N900.</p><p>Now the<acronym title="I still own it btw"><span class=caps>N900</span></acronym>is different. It is actually the coolest phone I&#8217;ve ever come across. Why? Because its a pure hacker&#8217;s device. <img src="/images/9d25.n900.png" class=right alt="">Based on a Linux Distribution called Maemo, it totally packs a punch. It has a terminal, you can sudo like any other Linux Distro and best of all its a completely <a href="http://www.maemo.org">community</a> driven effort. I am not selling this device, I have decided to keep it for as long as it functions. Nokia does not manufacture or support this device anymore, but the powerful user-driven community does and I am proud to be a part of it.</p><p><img src="/images/6d90.mango.png" class=left alt="">But I am looking forward to get something else to use as a secondary phone and you might&#8217;ve guessed it. Yes, the new windows phone based devices are among my list. I am a bit confused in what to get, but this post is about the Windows Phone and why it attracts me today. So lets bring in the reasons:</p><h3>Metro UI</h3><p>The new metro UI is awe-inspiring and to be honest I am bored by looking at the same UI of iOS and Android phones. So the UI is a welcome change.</p><h3>Live Tiles</h3><p>One of the best features are the live tiles, they are like widgets but only better. They work in real-time and show you live information such as messages, <span class=caps>GPS</span> location, Email etc. The new UI makes everything very accessible from the Home screen.</p><h3>Integrated Social Layer</h3><p>iOS 5 came with an integrated Twitter Layer for apps to utilize. Windows Phone 7.5 does the same, only it does it better. It has a complete social network layer and the people app. This brings your contacts and your social networks at one place. Your contacts&#8217; social network profiles are automatically synced with other information you have about them on your phone.</p><h3>Not a Battery Muncher</h3><p>Now this is way to good. All current phones running WP7 are not battery munchers like other smartphones. WP7 has a battery-saver function that saves up juice for when needed.</p><h3>Office Mobile</h3><p>With office mobile WP7 gives you the complete MS Office experience on your phone, now no other smartphone out there gives you this facility.</p><h3>Linked Inboxes</h3><p>No more people have to struggle between multiple inboxes. You can link them into one so that they become easily manageable.</p><p>So these are some of the reasons I am considering a Windows Phone. I would really appreciate if you could help me decide. Do leave me a comment. Rock n Roll!</p>An ex windows mobile user thinking to get the new windows phone.<br><a class=button-link href="/thoughts/2012/04/09/Windows-Phone-thoughts/">Read it</a><p class=tags>Posted under <a href="/categories/thoughts/">thoughts</a></p></article></li><li><article class=blog-post><div class=published>06 Apr 2012</div><h1><a href="/ios/2012/04/06/iOS-Accelerometer/">Hello Accelerometer</a></h1><p></p><p>The question new devs ask me the most is &#8220;How do we use the iPhone accelerometer?&#8221;, so I have decided to write a post about how to get data from the iOS device&#8217;s accelerometer.</p><p>The accelerometer is a sensitive piece of hardware that can detect the changing position of the device, from translation motion to rotation; it has the capability to detect the changes using a 3D coordinate system. Using the accelerometer devs can enhance the UX of their apps considerably, similarly game developers can make their games more engaging with it. In this blog post I am gonna show you how to get the accelerometer coordinate values and display them inside a label. So lets get started.</p><p>First lets create a simple UI in the interface builder:</p><p><img src="/images/505b.accell-ui.png" alt=""></p><p>That&#8217;s that a simple and clean UI. Now lets get to some action, lets write some code. First we create some IBOutlet properties in out interface file for our labels:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=objc><span class=cp>#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;</span>

<span class=k>@interface</span> <span class=nc>ViewController</span> : <span class=nc>UIViewController</span>

<span class=k>@property</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>nonatomic</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=n>strong</span><span class=p>)</span> <span class=kt>IBOutlet</span> <span class=n>UILabel</span> <span class=o>*</span><span class=n>xLabel</span><span class=p>;</span>
<span class=k>@property</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>nonatomic</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=n>strong</span><span class=p>)</span> <span class=kt>IBOutlet</span> <span class=n>UILabel</span> <span class=o>*</span><span class=n>yLabel</span><span class=p>;</span>
<span class=k>@property</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>nonatomic</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=n>strong</span><span class=p>)</span> <span class=kt>IBOutlet</span> <span class=n>UILabel</span> <span class=o>*</span><span class=n>zLabel</span><span class=p>;</span>

<span class=k>@end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We are not done with the interface file yet, we need to implement the UIAccelerometer delegate and create a property to access its values. So after adding these our interface would look like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=objc><span class=cp>#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;</span>

<span class=k>@interface</span> <span class=nc>ViewController</span> : <span class=nc>UIViewController</span> <span class=o>&lt;</span><span class=n>UIAccelerometerDelegate</span><span class=o>&gt;</span>



<span class=k>@property</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>nonatomic</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=n>strong</span><span class=p>)</span> <span class=kt>IBOutlet</span> <span class=n>UILabel</span> <span class=o>*</span><span class=n>xLabel</span><span class=p>;</span>
<span class=k>@property</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>nonatomic</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=n>strong</span><span class=p>)</span> <span class=kt>IBOutlet</span> <span class=n>UILabel</span> <span class=o>*</span><span class=n>yLabel</span><span class=p>;</span>
<span class=k>@property</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>nonatomic</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=n>strong</span><span class=p>)</span> <span class=kt>IBOutlet</span> <span class=n>UILabel</span> <span class=o>*</span><span class=n>zLabel</span><span class=p>;</span>

<span class=k>@property</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>nonatomic</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=n>strong</span><span class=p>)</span> <span class=n>UIAccelerometer</span> <span class=o>*</span><span class=n>accelerometer</span><span class=p>;</span>


<span class=k>@end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So all that takes care of the interface. Now we need to setup the accelerometer object so it can actually be of use. We now move to the implementation file of our project and modify the viewDidLoad method as follows:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=objc><span class=k>-</span> <span class=p>(</span><span class=kt>void</span><span class=p>)</span><span class=nf>viewDidLoad</span>
<span class=p>{</span>
    <span class=p>[</span><span class=n>super</span> <span class=n>viewDidLoad</span><span class=p>];</span>
	
    <span class=n>self</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>accelerometer</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=p>[</span><span class=n>UIAccelerometer</span> <span class=n>sharedAccelerometer</span><span class=p>];</span>
    <span class=n>self</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>accelerometer</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>updateInterval</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=mf>.2</span><span class=p>;</span>
    <span class=n>self</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>accelerometer</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>delegate</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=n>self</span><span class=p>;</span>
    
<span class=p>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Important thing to note here is how we have initialized the accelerometer object, one should never initialize a new instance of this object as its a shared resource. This is the correct way to initialize it. The other two statements are how we setup the update interval of the accelerometer and tell it whose going to be its delegate(in this case its our viewcontroller).</p><p>We are almost done with this example, the final piece of the puzzle is UIAccelerometer&#8217;s delegate method didAccelerate. We implement that this way:</p><div class=highlight><pre><code class=objc><span class=k>-</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=kt>void</span><span class=p>)</span><span class=nf>accelerometer:</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>UIAccelerometer</span> <span class=o>*</span><span class=p>)</span><span class=nv>accelerometer</span> <span class=nf>didAccelerate:</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>UIAcceleration</span> <span class=o>*</span><span class=p>)</span><span class=nv>acceleration</span><span class=p>{</span>
    
    <span class=n>self</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>xLabel</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>text</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=p>[</span><span class=n>NSString</span> <span class=n>stringWithFormat</span><span class=o>:</span><span class=s>@&quot;%f&quot;</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=n>acceleration</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>x</span><span class=p>];</span>
    <span class=n>self</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>yLabel</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>text</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=p>[</span><span class=n>NSString</span> <span class=n>stringWithFormat</span><span class=o>:</span><span class=s>@&quot;%f&quot;</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=n>acceleration</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>y</span><span class=p>];</span>
    <span class=n>self</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>zLabel</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>text</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=p>[</span><span class=n>NSString</span> <span class=n>stringWithFormat</span><span class=o>:</span><span class=s>@&quot;%f&quot;</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=n>acceleration</span><span class=p>.</span><span class=n>z</span><span class=p>];</span>
<span class=p>}</span>
