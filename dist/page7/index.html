The way information is available was once a <img class=right title=Internet src="http://picol.org/images/icons/files/png/128/internet_128.png" alt="" width=128 height=128>dream. My Software Engineering Professor, who is an ex-Software Dev recalls that when they used to encounter a developer&#8217;s block, it was nearly impossible to find reference or help like we do to today on the Internet. They had to go through manuals, books and talk to other experienced Devs who did not help easily. The world has changed now, information flows like the niagra falls. You can sit in your room, think about starting a business, in a couple of days do some R &amp; D and in a few weeks have a successful virtual business that not only ensures your financial security but also helps you network with other businesses. Offcourse luck is a big factor here.</p><p>So Thank you Web! For crawling out of your shell and making things easier. Also no thanks to you for turning most of my friends into couch potatoes.</p><br><a class=button-link href="/thoughts/2011/09/08/The-Web-The-Devs-and-The-Support/">Read it</a><p class=tags>Posted under <a href="/categories/thoughts/">thoughts</a></p></article></li><li><article class=blog-post><div class=published>11 Jul 2011</div><h1><a href="/thoughts/2011/07/11/Two-Years/">Two Years</a></h1><p></p><p>Its been 2 years today.

Wish I could tell you&#8230;how they all left me in one of the dark hours, the people you and I trusted the most.</p><p>I just wish wherever you are, you are happy&#8230;I miss you&#8230; thank you for everything&#8230;Father&#8230;</p><br><a class=button-link href="/thoughts/2011/07/11/Two-Years/">Read it</a><p class=tags>Posted under <a href="/categories/thoughts/">thoughts</a></p></article></li><li><article class=blog-post><div class=published>25 Nov 2010</div><h1><a href="/ios/2010/11/25/Async-Socket/">Asynchronous Socket Networking Library for Cocoa</a></h1><p></p><p>And just when I thought network programming on the iPhone would be a tough nut to crack:</p><p>CocoaAsyncSocket supports <span class=caps>TCP</span> and <span class=caps>UDP</span>. The AsyncSocket class is for <span class=caps>TCP</span>, and the AsyncUdpSocket class is for <span class=caps>UDP</span>. Each class is described below.</p><p>AsyncSocket is a <span class=caps>TCP</span>/IP socket networking library that wraps CFSocket and CFStream. It offers asynchronous operation, and a native cocoa class complete with delegate support. Here are the key features:</p><ul><li>Queued non-blocking reads and writes, with optional timeouts. You tell it what to read or write, and it will call you when it&#8217;s done.</li></ul><ul><li>Automatic socket acceptance. If you tell it to accept connections, it will call you with new instances of itself for each connection. You can, of course, disconnect them immediately.</li></ul><ul><li>Delegate support. Errors, connections, accepts, read completions, write completions, progress, and disconnections all result in a call to your delegate method.</li></ul><ul><li>Run-loop based, not thread based. Although you can use it on main or worker threads, you don&#8217;t have to. It calls the delegate methods asynchronously using NSRunLoop. The delegate methods include a socket parameter, allowing you to distinguish between many instances.</li></ul><ul><li>Self-contained in one class. You don&#8217;t need to muck around with streams or sockets. The class handles all of that.</li></ul><ul><li>Support for <span class=caps>TCP</span> streams over IPv4 and IPv6.</li></ul><p>The library is public domain, originally written by Dustin Voss. Now available in a public setting to allow and encourage its continued support.</p><p>AsyncUdpSocket is a <span class=caps>UDP</span>/IP socket networking library that wraps CFSocket. It works almost exactly like the <span class=caps>TCP</span> version, but is designed specifically for <span class=caps>UDP</span>. This includes queued non-blocking send/receive operations, full delegate support, run-loop based, self-contained class, and support for IPv4 and IPv6.</p><p>check it out at:</p><p>http://code.google.com/p/cocoaasyncsocket/</p><br><a class=button-link href="/ios/2010/11/25/Async-Socket/">Read it</a><p class=tags>Posted under <a href="/categories/ios/">ios</a></p></article></li><li><article class=blog-post><div class=published>09 Mar 2010</div><h1><a href="/thoughts/2010/03/09/La-Studio-Coke-Rocking-the-World/">La Studio Coke...Rocking the world</a></h1><p></p><p><img src="http://www.cokestudio.com.pk/Images/general/large/004.jpg" class=aligncenter alt=""><br>Its not everyday you come across good projects promoting Pakistan in the world. Its no longer the era in which Junoon or the Vital Signs made Pakland famous all over the world, new blood has taken over and they are really rocking. We got Mauj a free-spirited fiery young band, the amazing Shafqat Amanat Ali whose voice works magic, Zeb and Haniya the talented duo, the ever amazing Rahat Fateh Ali khan who has been tutored by the great Maestro of vocals himself and many more&#8230;all of them represent Pakistan with their respective genres of music. every now and then some event or a project surfaces that brings these great artists together on one platform&#8230;<br>One such project i really respect and salute is Coke Studio. A platform that truly shows harmony of our nation and the talent of our Artists. the brainchild of Rohail Hayat brings together multiple artists to perform live in groups or individually. Coke Studio like no other sets a standard in music. with great artitst including Atif Aslam, Ali Azmat, Strings, Shafqat Amanat Ali, Saieen Zahoor just to name a few. this project promotes peace and harmony by combining the music of artists of all genres be it folk, classical, pop or rock. it truly creates a space of peaceful, memorable bits of life once you listen to the music. With 5 episodes done till now Coke studio has a bright future ahead, and surely this platform is really necessary to show the real true-spirited Pakistanis we are. we love our culture and we know how to blend in. here is a short description from the studio&#8217;s site:</p><p>Coke Studio embodies a musical fusion of exciting elements and diverse influences, ranging from traditional eastern, modern western and regionally inspired music. Bringing alive the magic of live recordings and performances, Coke Studio prides itself on providing a musical platform which bridges barriers, celebrates diversity, encourages unity and instils a sense of Pakistani pride. Coke Studio is an inspired step by Coca-Cola for having created a platform where renowned as well as upcoming and less mainstream musicians from various genres can collaborate musically.</p><p>Impressed? give it a try. i guarantee you will enjoy it.</p><p>http://www.cokestudio.com.pk</p><p>towards glory :)</p><br><a class=button-link href="/thoughts/2010/03/09/La-Studio-Coke-Rocking-the-World/">Read it</a><p class=tags>Posted under <a href="/categories/thoughts/">thoughts</a></p></article></li><li><article class=blog-post><div class=published>08 Mar 2010</div><h1><a href="/thoughts/2010/03/08/Fedora-Pakistan/">Fedora Pakistan - The Revolution</a></h1><p></p><p>I have been a Fedora Project ambassador now for almost an year&#8230; Fedora is an open source operating system based on the Linux Kernel. Its developed and maintained by volunteers like me from all over the world. The project&#8217;s activity in Pakistan has been very low, only 11 ambassadors<a href="http://dejavu87.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/logo_fedoralogo.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-141" title="Fedora  Logo" src="http://dejavu87.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/logo_fedoralogo.png?w=300" alt="" width=300 height=91></a>, not many developers, just some geeks who know its true power and use it in their homes or some ISPs who use it for hosting purposes.</p><p>But all this is about to change now, and we are the ones who are going be the catalysts in this change. Fedora Pakistan is now more organized than ever, we have active members and a stronger web presence. I have a really good feeling about this, plus my fellow ambassadors are great people specially Mustufa and Aamir.</p><p>Its not only the Fedora Project, numerous other open source projects are gaining momentum in Pakistan such as <a title=LinuxUrduCBTs href="http://www.linuxurducbts.com" target=_blank>LinuxUrduCBTs</a>, <a title=wbitt.com href="http://www.wbitt.com" target=_blank><span class=caps>WBITT</span></a> which come under the flag of Pakistan Open Source Foundation. they are like us, we all are one and we are ready to change Pakistan&#8217;s future. If you feel like being part of this movement join us today. help us Fedorize Pakistan to a better, powerful and efficient IT infrastructure.</p><p>You can follow our activities on <a href="http://twitter.com/FedoraPakistan" target=_blank>Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Fedora-Pakistan/329228907438" target=_blank>Facebook</a></p><p>Long live Fedora, long live Pakistan &#8211; amen</p><br><a class=button-link href="/thoughts/2010/03/08/Fedora-Pakistan/">Read it</a><p class=tags>Posted under <a href="/categories/thoughts/">thoughts</a></p></article></li><li><article class=blog-post><div class=published>27 Feb 2010</div><h1><a href="/web/2010/02/27/Ethics-Source-Code-Sharing/">Ethics of source code sharing</a></h1><p></p><p>Ever since the advent of open source softwares, there have been lot of discussions about the ethics of code sharing in the open source community. For something so important and useful, one has to follow some guidelines or rules to make it compatible with a standard or an ethical approach.</p><p>If ethics are not properly followed code sharing will become more like a hit and run case, where a person works really hard on something and then loses all of gaining no fame or appreciation at all because somebody took his idea, his code and made changes to it to make be proclaimed as a genius.</p><p>When somebody is sharing his code to the world, it is important that his name is kept alive in all modifications of his work; the best example is that of Linux operating system. Linux was built by <strong>Linus Trovalds</strong> and now it enjoys the liberty of being the core of many distributions all around the world. It is an ethical and correct way that these distributions clearly state that they are based on Linux originally created by Linus Trovalds.</p><p>Now that open source movement has evolved and accepted almost all over the world. It should always be kept ethical to produce and consume <strong><span class=caps>FOSS</span></strong>(free and open source software). We shall see some of the ethics in detail:</p><h3>Supporting the cause</h3><p>When using <strong><span class=caps>FOSS</span></strong>, the user should be loyal to the people behind the software. He should promote their work, if he is a developer then support it as well. And if he sees some room for improvement he should let the developers know in a cool manner rather than thrashing them for not fixing a bug. One has to remember that people have built this software for the world to use free of charge and not for profit, help them make it better.</p><h3>Share the love and the code</h3><p>If software has been built on existing code, then it should remain open source and its code should be available to other developers as well.</p><p>Microsoft clearly disobeyed this principle when they developed the popular Xbox game <strong>Gears of War</strong>on an open source Gaming Engine called the <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>. It was non-ethical to use an open source software to create such a great game and then not sharing its code. In my opinion if that game had been open source, number of mods and plugins that would’ve enhanced the overall gaming experience would now be available by the geeky open source community.</p><h3>Give credit to the original developer when modifying</h3><p>A popular open source license type known as <strong><span class=caps>GNU</span> Public License(<span class=caps>GPL</span>)</strong> emphasizes on one thing <em>“modifications to this code are not allowed without credit to the original developer”</em>. This line is extremely important and not following it is declared extremely unethical. Not giving credit to the original developer or designer means you are ripping off his work and not even taking the liberty to thank him just once.</p><h3>Using the proper method to share Code</h3><p>There exist a number of methods to share source code in the proper view through version controlling, a few of which are:<br><ul><br><li><em><span class=caps>SVN</span></em></li><br><li><em><span class=caps>CVS</span></em></li><br><li><em>Bazaar</em></li><br><li><em>Git</em></li><br><li><em>Mercurial</em></li><br><li><em><span class=caps>SVK</span></em></li><br><li><em>Monotone</em></li></ul></p></article></li></ul><p>Each of these softwares provide a unique way to share the code to a repository from where other uses can obtain it. They work in such a way that code is always kept up to date and minute of changes can be shared with the world with a click of a button.</p><h3>Final Word</h3><p>If you don’t steal a car, a tv, a mobile phone or a laptop computer then how can you steal somebody’s source code. Yes, source code copying without the proper guidelines is stealing and is an offense punishable as a crime in the IT industry.</p><p>So if you are a supporter of <span class=caps>FOSS</span> and freedom of expression, be ethical.</p><br><a class=button-link href="/web/2010/02/27/Ethics-Source-Code-Sharing/">Read it</a><p class=tags>Posted under <a href="/categories/web/">web</a></p><div class=blog-pagination><div class=newer><a href="/page6/">« Newer posts</a></div><div class=older><a href="/page8/">Older posts »</a></div></div></div><aside class=col-md-3><h2>Ali Raza</h2><img src="/images/cda2.ali.jpg" class="img-circle img-responsive"><p>Tech.
