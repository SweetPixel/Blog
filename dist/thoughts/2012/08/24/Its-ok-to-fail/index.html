This is not a motivational post to tell you its all going to be fine, in fact this is a list of epic fails from my own life to tell you that it&#8217;s ok to fail. Its all a part of your life and the most valuable lessons you learn are from failures/embarrassing moments. So here&#8217;s my list of Epic Fails, enjoy:</p><h3>Got Punched by a girl</h3><p><strong>Failometer Level:</strong> 3/10</p><p>This is the oldest epic fail I can remember. There was this girl, I dont remember her name, she was a bully(I did not know it either). She was playing with sand(used to be a hit back then). So me being a curious person I am, asked her nicely what was she building only to be punched in the face(she had a wicked arm I tell you). I completely blacked out, cried in a corner, was too afraid to tell the teacher and had a swollen lip. Girl! I hope wherever you are, Karma got the best of you and your marriage is in shambles and you quitely cry yourself to sleep thinking about the little boy you punched. Screw You!</p><p><em>Lesson Learnt:</em> If somebody is mean to you, kick their ass</p><h3>Was a Carrot</h3><p><strong>Failometer Level:</strong> Carrot/10</p><p><img src="/images/fb65.220px-CarrotRoots.jpg" class=left alt="">This is another one from school. I was among the really tall kids in my class and there was moment when I was the tallest. Annual day was coming and teacher tells us we are going to be playing vegetables. Everybody is super excited offcourse, except me. Why? The teacher tells me, as I am very tall I get to be a carrot. I could see it coming but went along with it anyway. So I played the role of a carrot, and had to live by the nickname of Gajar(Carrot in Urdu) for like a very long time. I have the video of it somewhere on <span class=caps>VHS</span>, if anybody has the equipment to convert it to digital format please let me know so that I may once again live the embarrassment.</p><p><em>Lesson Learnt:</em> Dont be a Carrot</p><h3>Got Stitches for trying to act Cool</h3><p><strong>Failometer Level:</strong> 6.5/10</p><p>Another one from my school days(Yeah I know). This one was made to look like an accident for the sake of two things:</p><ol><li>Not to get busted for breaking a glass pane in the door.</li><li>Not to look like an idiot who just tried to pull off a stunt to look cool and got a bloody arm as a result.</li></ol><p><img src="/images/6474.stitches.jpg" class=right alt="">The story is that I was performing whudu(abulation) in the wash room and all of a sudden this troll friend of mine appears and locks the door behind me. Now I act cool(panic mode: on) and decide to break one the glass panes in the door to open the lock. With all my force I punched the glass pane, hear the triumphant sound of it shattering and open the door. As soon as I come out, I get a feeling something is not right. I look at my hand to find it bleeding like &#8220;<span class=caps>OMG</span>!!! Its time to panic, quick scream like a little girl and embarrass yourself&#8221;. I made up a story that I slipped when somebody was opening the door from the other side and my hand went throught the glass pane. Why am I telling the truth now? because screw the school, it does not even exist anymore(They sold it off to make a buck load of money). I got five stitches(the bad part) and a couple of days off(the good part).</p><p><em>Lesson Learnt:</em> Dont Panic</p><h3>New Shirt, Forgot to take Price Tag <span class=caps>OFF</span></h3><p><strong>Failometer Level:</strong> 2/10</p><p>This one is from the glorious days of university. I was the newly appointed President of the Computer Cell(a Team of Awesome People like me who loved to code and had a problem with almost everything) and as my first order or business I called a meeting to throw away ideas. Throughout the meeting my fellow people kept on smiling and giggling while elbowing each other. I knew something was wrong, at first I thought my fly was open(Thank God it was not). After the meeting I was told by a friend that I have a price tag on my shirt, which shows it was recently bought. I could not think of anything to say at that moment and spent the rest of the day staring blankly out of the cafeteria window.</p><p><em>Lesson Learnt:</em> Pay attention to your wardrobe</p><h3>Made the jump of the century, sprained my ankle</h3><p><strong>Failometer Level:</strong> 7/10</p><p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Ankle_en.svg/230px-Ankle_en.svg.png" class=right alt="">This epic fail happened when I was gone for my <span class=caps>ISSB</span> Examination. For those of you who do not know, its an exam you have to appear for in order to get selected in the Armed Forces of Pakistan. Its an intensive test of physical and mental endurannce in which they interview you, ask embarrassing questions, make you run through an obstacle course and force you to go to sleep before 11 pm. No, I did not die and Yes I did not get selected, instead I earned the worst ever sprain my ankle has ever felt. I had to jump off a platform, climb on another that was 5 feet high and finally jump on the ground to land safely on some sand. I make the most awesome jump ever(<strong>insert dramatic music</strong>) and instead of landing on the sand I landed feet first on solid ground. As a result I got a sprained ankle and had difficulty walking for weeks.</p><p><em>Lesson Learnt:</em> Look before you leap.</p><h3>Forgot the lyrics of a song I was singing</h3><p><strong>Failometer Level:</strong> Don&#8217;t Ask/10</p><p>This is the most epic fail ever and I have video proof of it. I was taking part in a competition at my university and had to sing a song. So I chose a song I really like and went along singning it. It was going very well(as you can observe by the applause) when my scumbag brain decided to forget the lyrics in between and make me choke. Thankfully the audience helped me remember and I continued to sing but I am never going to forget this epic fail, ever! Here is the video:</p><p><iframe src="http://www.twitvid.com/embed.php?guid=AZA7S&autoplay=0" title="Twitvid video player " class=twitvid-player type="text/html" width=480 height=360 frameborder=0></iframe></p><h2>Final Words</h2><p>Your epic fails are awesome(so are you!) and when you recall them you realize what a fun life you&#8217;ve had. I am not ashamed of these moments(Duh! I just wrote about them) for they have shaped me into a better and stronger person. So don&#8217;t be embarrassed to remember and laugh out loud on your epic fails Feel free to share them in the comments if you would like. Hope you enjoyed this post my dear readers.</p></article><div class=row id=disqus_thread></div><script type="text/javascript">/* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT BEFORE PASTING INTO YOUR WEBPAGE * * */
